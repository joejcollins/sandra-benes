## Swarm, unmarked 2012 Queen

4/92012 Sold to Genevieve.

2/8/2012 Removed Snelgrove board and squeezed on to 11 brood frames.

30/7/2012 Put Queen on bottom below the Snelgrove board.

29/7/2012 They have eaten through the paper, and need another frame.

27/7/2012 Saw eggs, so Q laying now, didn't see Q.  Moved on top of [Marigold]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2012-marigold.html) with a Snelgrove board and piece of paper in between

23/7/2012 Saw queen, unmarked so not [Amber]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2012-amber.html), not laying yet.  Queen was on crown board.

21/7/2012 Caught swarm from [Marigold]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2012-marigold.html). It could be [Amber]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2012-amber.html).
