## 2025 Marked Queen

2025-09-06 Apiguard tray two on.  Also added half a block of Candipolline Gold.

2025-08-28 Put on a blob of MegaBee (which was made up from 75 g of MegaBee powder and thick syrup).

2025-08-25 Put on a patty of MegaBee (which was made up from 50 g of MegaBee powder and thick syrup).  Also put on a 330 g of Candipolline Gold to see if they would like that too.  Also added thick syrup in a bowl and straw feeder.

2025-08-22 Apiguard on, 10 days late.

2025-08-22 Varroa slide out.  Count 27.  The slide was in for 5 days not 7, so the daily count is 5.5.  The National Bee unit say that May to August: Multiply by 30.  Giving 165.  Treatment must happen before you reach 1000.

2025-08-17 Put in the varroa slide.

2025-08-16 Plenty of eggs in the bottom box.  Only honey in the top box.  Saw the queen.  The have eaten/removed about a third of the patty.  There is plenty of yellow dust under the hive so it could be either or both.

2025-08-13 Put on a patty of MegaBee (which was made up from 125 g of MegaBee powder and thick syrup).  Saw the queen while I was at it.

2025-08-08 No eggs or brood, didn't see the queen.  There is only a small patch of brood.

2025-07-21 Saw the queen, eggs and brood.  A suspicious amount of back filling going on it the top brood box, but no signs of swarming.

2025-07-14 Saw the queen, eggs and brood.  Plenty of stores but none in the super that has all be eaten, I am guessing because of the drought there is no nectar.

2025-07-05 Saw eggs and brood, no signs of swarming.  Reduced the entrance because there are lots of wasps around.

2025-06-30 Upgraded to 10 x 10 frames.

2025-06-29 Didn't see the queen, but saw eggs and no signs of swarming.  They probably need a couple more brood frames and a super.

2025-06-21 Found the queen and marked her.  Eggs and larvae in all stages.  There is a naff frame on one end of the top box that needs replacing.

2025-06-13 Laying well but needs more space.  Put on another brood box bringing them up to 8 x 8 F.

2025-06-07 Laying queen with brood at all stages of development.

2025-05-30 Not doing anything with the super, not time to check for laying yet.

2025-05-06 Culled down to one queen cell on the south face of frame 5, marked with a blue pin.

2025-04-28 Frames with eggs from [Regina]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2023-regina.html) to raise an emergency queen.  There are loads of bees so it should be fine.
