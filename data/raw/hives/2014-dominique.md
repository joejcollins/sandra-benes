## 2014 Queen

27/6/2015 Queen lost so merged with [Marit]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2015-marit.html).

23/6/2015 Swarmed on to bottom of hive.  Shook back in after removing the queen cells to [Bella]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2015-bella.html).  So I hope the queen is in there.

4/6/2015 Laying well and covering 8 frames.  Saw eggs but didn't see the queen.

23/5/2015 Saw eggs but didn't see the queen.  They are covering 4 frames.

18/5/2015 Took down the single queen cell and shook off 3 frames and gave them to Ulrika.  The frames had eggs to test if [Ulrika]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2014-ulrika.html) has a queen or not.  There were no signs of emergency cells so this one might have a queen.

16/5/2015 Saw queen cells and eggs but couldn't find queen.  Left a queen seal in both hives and split them.  One queen cell is in the cull frame and was left in the hive with the supers.  The other queen cell went with the 9 frames on one side.  The plan is to review on Monday afternoon.  I should be able to tell which hive has the queen in at that point.  This was the **top brood box**.

10/5/2015  Saw eggs but didn't see the queen. There was some drone comb in the super.  No signs of swarming.

5/4/2015 No signs of swarming, saw eggs but didn't see the queen. Culled some drone comb.

26/4/2015 Lots of brood, possibly running out of laying space.  Didn't see the queen.  It was cool weather so they were a little pissed off.

18/4/2015 Plenty of brood and food.  Saw eggs but didn't see the queen.  Put on a single super.

10/4/2015 Quick nose in the top.  Plenty of food and bees.  Maybe add supers?

5/4/2015 Most of the 9 frames in the top are jammed with honey.  The bottom box has eggs, grubs and brood frames.  Very busy.  No worries about food or stimulation.  Didn't see the queen.

25/12/2014 Oxalic acid treatment.  There were 6 seams of bees (big colony) in the bottom box towards the North side.  Plenty of weight in the top box.  Put on candy block.

17/9/2014 Took off the Apiguard, plenty of bees and honey.

6/8/2014 Put on the first Apiguard treatment.  They seemed a bit cramped and might need another brood frame.

4/8/2014 Didn't see the queen but no chalkbrood and lots of eggs.

17/7/2014 Saw brood and eggs, but didn't see the queen.  A lot of chalkbrood, not working the super.

10/7/2014 Saw brood and eggs, but didn't see the queen.  No signs of swarming.  Not working their super very much.

30/6/2014 Saw brood and eggs, but didn't see the queen.  No signs of swarming but masses of brood.  Put on a super to give them something to do.

20/6/2014 Merge has gone well.  Eggs and brood, didn't see the queen.

12/6/2014 No signs of a queen (no eggs or brood) but plenty of polished cells.

19/5/2014 Merged in [Garton]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2012-garton.html).

18/5/2014 Cut down to one queen cell, marked with a pin.

13/5/2014 Created from [Garton]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2012-garton.html).  Four queen cells.  Two on the bottom of the cull frame one of which (in the middle at the bottom) is sealed.  All marked with pins.
