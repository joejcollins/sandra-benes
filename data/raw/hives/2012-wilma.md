## White marked 2014 Queen

13/7/2014 Taken away by Pauline.

12/7/2014 Put them in Pauline's kit.

10/7/2014 Saw the queen, brood and eggs.  All good, called Pauline to let her know that everything was fine.

3/7/2014 Saw the queen and marked her.

30/6/2014 Saw brood and eggs, but didn't see the queen.

20/6/2014 Saw brood and eggs, added 3 frames of food and moved from off of [Nina]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2014-nina.html).  The queen is unmarked, need to mark and let them settle before I can sell it to Pauline.

12/6/2014 No signs of eggs but the queen cell is open with a proper little hatch attached to it.  So either we have had a cast or that was the right cell.

6/6/2014 There is an open queen cell with the side take down and a second one on the bottom of the frame.  Er...don't know if which one is the right one.  No signs of eggs.

26/5/2014 No eggs or signs of a queen, do I guess she got lost on the trip out last week.  She had ragged wings so this makes sense.  There were queen cells so I cut them down to one queen cell.

19/5/2014 Seemed to swarm and then go back (this might have been the red queen with the ragged wings).  Took down the queen cell and pull on top of [Nina]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2014-nina.html) with a Snelgrove board in between.  If the queen made it back we should see eggs in a few days.  If she didn't then the colony can be re-ordered as a double brood.

18/5/2014 Think they might have swarmed.  Left one queen cell, marked with a pin.

9/5/2014 Saw the queen and eggs, took down one queen cell.  Need more space,  moved to the other side of [Nina]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2014-nina.html) to bleed off the bees and added two frames.

3/5/2014 Found queen cells so I marked two with pins and put together another colony ([Nina]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2014-nina.html)).  This is the Celia Davis method so this queen was removed to one side.  Found and marked the queen red.

26/4/2014 Saw eggs, brood and 1 frame of stores.  Saw one charged queen cell.  Put on the feeder again.

18/4/2014 Saw eggs, brood and stores. Bees pretty much on all 16 frames.  Drone cells coming in plausible locations.  Didn't see the queen.

4/4/2014 Saw eggs, brood and plenty of food.  Didn't see the queen.  Starting to make drone cells already.

28/12/2013 Oxalic acid treatment.

24/8/2013 Put on MAQS between the brood boxes

20/8/2013 Removed the full super.  Needs MAQS in a couple of days.

19/8/2013 Removed two supers and put on another empty.  Put on the clearer board to clear the last full super.

18/8/2013 Stacked into 8 x 8 and put the clearer board on for two of the supers.

10/8/2013 Saw eggs, saw the queen, but fluffed up marking her.

22/7/2013 Plenty of eggs and grubs.  Saw the queen but messed up marking her because my gloves were sticky with propolis.  It is a pretty sticky hive.  Put on a 4th super because the others were heavy.

13/7/2013 No eggs, bees pissed off.  Put a frame of eggs in at F7 to see if they are queenless.

22/6/2013 Removed all the emergency queen cells (I think) and left a single queen cell (from [Garton]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2012-garton.html)) from the 4 that were marked the previous time.  Leave for 3 weeks.

15/6/2013 Removed the queen ([Garton]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2012-garton.html)) and left 4 unsealed queen cells marked with round headed pins.  Three at the bottom of one frame and one at the bottom of another frame.There are two queen cells on the cull frame.  Bad tempered.  Added another super (there are now three).

9/6/2013 Saw the queen and eggs.  There were a few weak charged queen cells which I removed.  I am expecting some better looking queen cells so I can use the Celia Davis method next week, Thursday or Friday.

2/6/2013 Saw the queen, saw eggs, no signs of swarm preparation.  Removed two unused brood frames.  Not as busy as [Buster]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2012-buster.html) so I took a sample of workers to test for nosema.

26/5/2013 Put on another super, reasonably docile.

19/5/2013 Put on a super.

18/5/2013 Removed feeder, did not see queen but saw eggs some free drones, loads of bees.  Some space for stores but needs supers.

6/5/2013 Influx of flying bees from [Alice]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2012-alice.html) so added two extra frames.  Added feeder with thin syrup.

3/5/2014 Queen present and laying, no free drones but some drone cells.  Not much stores, only about 2 frames.

20/4/2014 Queen present and laying, no free drones but some drone cells.

29/3/2013 Check the candy, very little eaten.

6/1/2013 Put on a block of candy.

1/1/2013 Oxalic acid treatment.

14/9/2012 Removed Apiguard treatment, the varroa board had wax moth larvae on it when I removed it.

16/8/2012 Added second Apiguard treatment, and feed.

2/8/2012 Started Apiguard treatment, and feeding.
