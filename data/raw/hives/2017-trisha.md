## Yellow 2017 Queen

2017-08-04 Culled the queen and united the bees with [Teresa]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2019-teresa.html).

2017-07-23 Swapped position with [Sarah]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2017-sarah.html) to reduce numbers in this colony.

2017-07-23 Introducing the queen on the frame seems to have worked.  I saw her and marked her.  I saw eggs.  There is some remaining drone from the drone laying worker but I am hoping it will settle.  The queen was very fast moving so hard to capture and mark.

2017-07-17 No signs of a queen, I am thinking they are queenless.  I took the queen that I found in [Yolanda]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2017-yolanda.html) and put her in on a frame in a newspaper bag at F4 counting from the North.  Also put a frame from of brood (might be drone but could be worker) in at F2 counting from the North.

2017-07-08 No pollen coming in, there are shiny cells that might be preparation for brood.  The remaining workers have emerged and there are a few drones left to emerge.  They were a bit fractious, if forced to guess I would say there may be no queen but too early to tell.

2017-07-01 The queen cell was opened at the side, not emerged properly.  Polished cells but no eggs.  I am going to assume that the hive is queenless.  So I swapped in a queen cell on a cull frame from [Rosie]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2017-rosie.html).

2017-06-18  Brood and queen cells from [Dina]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2016-dina.html) which was artificially swarmed.  Checked for queen cells, there was one on the North side of F4 (counting from the South).  Well, it looked like one.  The bees kept looking in it so I didn't smoke it to look myself.  That was all that I saw so I marked it with a red pin.
