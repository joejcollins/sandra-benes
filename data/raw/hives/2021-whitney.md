## 11 x 11 F

## 2021 Marked Queen

2023-04-18 Sold.

2023-04-15 Squeezed down on to 11 frames of brood.

2023-04-13 About 7 frames with brood in the top, 5 frames in the bottom.  Didn't see the queen but I saw eggs.

2023-02-18 Candy all gone so I put on a feeder.

2023-01-02 API-Bioxal (oxalic acid treatment) and candy block.

2022-09-18 Took off the Apiguard treatment.

2022-08-28 Added the second Apiguard treatment.

2022-08-14 Merged with 11 frames from [Yulinar]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2022-yulinar.html) and added the first Apiguard treatment.

2022-07-23 Saw eggs and brood, didn't see the queen no signs of swarming. Looking good could probably sell.

2022-07-16 Added two frames of brood from [Winnie]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2021-winnie.html) to build this one up faster.

2022-07-13 Saw eggs and a yellow marked queen so it is definitely Whitney.  They are covering about 4 full frames.

2022-07-08 Swarmed into the damson tree, so we collected it and hived it on 11 new frames.  So it wasn't superceding.

2022-07-01 Saw eggs and brood, but didn't see the queen.  There as a queen cell with an egg in it (in the top brood box, on the east side of the third frame from the west) marked with a black pin.  Superceding perhaps?  There weren't a great deal of eggs given that it is mid summer.  The queen was late mating in August last year so possibly not well mated.

2022-06-29 Added a super because they are looking a bit full.

2022-06-23 Saw eggs and brood, but didn't see the queen. Pretty busy so I added two more brood frames.

2022-06-17 Saw eggs and brood, but didn't see the queen.  No signs of swarming.

2022-06-10 Saw eggs and brood, but didn't see the queen.  A lot of bees but no signs of swarming they will need more space.  Made it into a double brood, with 8 x 8 F.

2022-06-04 Saw eggs, brood and the queen,  No signs of swarming.  Put on a feeder.

2022-05-28 Sealed queen cells on the bottom of frames which broke when I took out the frames.  Some back filling.  Split it amd made up [Yvette]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2022-yvette.html) on the original site.

2022-05-21 Saw eggs and grubs but didn't see the queen, no signs of swarming.

2022-05-14 No signs of swarming.  The empty super from was drawn out but the supers aren't getting full.

2022-05-05 Added a super but didn't check them because [Winnie]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2021-winnie.html) wasn't swarming.

2022-04-30 Plenty of bees, no signs of swarming.

2022-04-24 Plenty of bees, put on a super.  No signs of swarming, but they are making drones.

2022-03-26 Marked the queen.  Probably about one frame of brood and eggs.  Some stores but I topped up the feeder.

2022-03-21 The candy block was completely consumed so I put on a rapid feeder as a precaution.

2021-12-20 API-Bioxal (oxalic acid treatment), the bees were quite low down, in the bottom brood box.  Put on a block of candy.

2021-09-17 Brood and grubs will assume that the queen is good.

2021-09-06 Took off the MAQS and started feeding again.

2021-08-30 Put the MAQS strips on between the two brood boxes.

2021-08-22 United using newspaper.

2021-08-20 Swarmed (I think) to the old pear tree.  I took down the remaining three queen cells and put the swarm in a brood box on top of a Snelgrove board.  The plan is to merge them in a few days time.

2021-08-08 No signs of queen cells.  I added another frame of eggs from [Bethany]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2020-bethany.html).  The others that I put in last week are just being raised normally.

2021-08-01 No signs of queen cells, maybe the one that was there emerged.  I added another frame of eggs from [Bethany]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2020-bethany.html).  The others that I put in last week are just being raised normally.

2021-07-25 Put in in more eggs from [Bethany]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2020-bethany.html).  There was no queen cells on the previous brood frame that we put in 2 days ago (it just looked like the cells had been sealed).  There were queen cells in the honey area along with a load of drone brood.  I removed two frames from the honey area which had drone brood on them.

2021-07-23 Drone laying in the honey supers.  There is a single queen cell on the brood frame marked with a black pin and a number of queen cells in the honey super.  Added a frame of eggs and open brood from [Bethany]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2020-bethany.html).

2021-07-17 No sign of a laying queen, honey in the brood chamber.  Added a frame of brood and eggs from [Bethany]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2020-bethany.html) with the intention of raising an emergency queen.

2021-07-14 No sign of a laying queen.

2021-06-12 Went through the brood box and culled the emergency cells.  There were about 20.  Left a single queen cell on the North side, bottom of frame 4 (counting from the South).

2021-06-05 Made up with 11 frames from [Bethany]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2020-bethany.html) and removed Bethany to the side.
