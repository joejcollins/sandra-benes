## 2024 Unmarked Queen

2024-10-26 Died out, just two frames of bees.

2024-09-21 Removed the ApiGuard and bucket feeder.

2024-08-24 Second tray of ApiGuard and bucket feeder refilled.

2024-08-11 ApiGuard and bucket feeder on.

2024-08-09 Merged with [Gwen]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2024-gwen.html) since Gwen appeared to have no queen and they need to be treated with ApiGuard.

2024-07-26 Saw eggs and grubs no sealed brood yet.  It is 20 days since I caught the swarm.  Saw the queen (she seemed a bit small) and marked her.

2024-07-19 They have drawn 4 or 5 frames, there are patches that look like they are waiting for laying but I saw no eggs.

2024-07-07 Swarm from [Gwendolyn]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2024-gwendolyn.html).
