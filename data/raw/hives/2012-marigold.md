# Marigold

## 6F+1C+2D x 7F+2D

## yellow marked 2012 Queen (swarmed?)

27/7/2012 Removed emergency cells, well pissed off, put on Snelgrove board and put [Harry]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2012-harry.html) on top.

24/7/2012 QC was damaged.  Sealed emergency cells.  Merge with [Buster]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2012-buster.html)?

21/7/2012 Left one sealed QC in top box, didn't see any eggs

14/7/2012 Left two unsealed QCs with grubs on Top F5, but saw eggs on Top F7

5/7/2012 Saw eggs removed QC to [Alice]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2012-alice.html)

3/7/2012 Eggs in top brood box, brood in supers and bottom box.  Queen excluders haven't worked to separate the two queens.  Sealed queen cells.  Destroyed all queen cells and restacked with 2 supers on top rather than a 2 queen system.

23/6/2012 Really pissed off, queenless? Make a two Queen system with [Amber]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2012-amber.html) on top and possible queen at bottom.  On the theory that if the queen in the bottom wasn't there or didn't come good I would simply merge the two brood boxes.
