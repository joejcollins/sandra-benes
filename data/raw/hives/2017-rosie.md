## Emerged Queen Cell

2017-07-18 Took down queen cells and put [Teresa]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2019-teresa.html) on top to unite using newspaper.

2017-07-17 There is half a frame of brood and it has emergency cells on it.  Not sure about these Slovenian queens maybe they don't suit the UK.

2017-07-08 No pollen coming in, no signs of brood or preparation for brood.  They seem quite calm so I would guess that there is a queen some where, but I didn't see her.  They do need more space.  A couple of frames should do it.  So I took a couple from [Sarah]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2017-sarah.html).

2017-07-02 Queen cell emerged.  Took down everything else that looked like a queen cell.

2017-07-01-T18:10 I took the cull frame and put it in [Trisha]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2017-trisha.html) together with a queen cell.  By this time one of the queen cells had opened.

2017-07-01-T14:05 Checked inside.  There are two sealed queen cells on the South side of the cull frame.  And an opened queen cell on the North side of F4, together with an apparently sealed queen cell.  Both were very small and improbable.

2017-07-01-T13:45 The box is now empty and there is no swarm on the hive.

2017-07-01-T11:55 Bees swarming up the front of the hive.  Working assumption is that it is a cast with an unmated queen (so I missed a queen cell in the hive).  So I shook the bees into a box and put them on a sheet to capture the swarm.

2017-06-17 [Andrea]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2017-andrea.html) appeared to swarm but was limited because the queen was clipped.  Old queen ([Andrea]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2017-andrea.html)) dead in clump with a new queen.  I put the new queen in a nucleus hive ([Teresa]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2019-teresa.html)) with 3 frames.  One sealed queen cell on the South side of the cull frame marked with a black pin.
