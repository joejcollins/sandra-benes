## 2021 Marked Queen

2022-04-17 Sold.

2022-04-14 Moved into box ready for sale.

2022-03-26 Marked the queen.  Probably half a frame of brood and eggs.  Not a lot of stores so I put on a feeder.

2021-12-20 API-Bioxal (oxalic acid treatment), the bees were quite low down, in the bottom brood box.  Put on a block of candy.

2021-09-17 Brood and grubs will assume that the queen is good.  United with [Winona]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2021-winona.html) on top because Winnoa was queenless.

2021-09-04 Not so many bees so I took off a super and put a clearer on another super.  There are polished cells but no sign of eggs.

2021-08-20 Queen cells from  [Berenice]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2020-berenice.html).  There are three queen cells near each other on a frame marked with a black pin (third from the North).  They look like they are about to pop.
