2020-04-12 Sold to Rachel.

2020-04-05 Removed the candy and reduced to 11 frames.

2020-03-22 Not seen on candy.  They are bringing in pollen.

2020-02-21 Not seen on candy.

2020-02-02 Not seen on candy.

2020-01-18 Bees flying at 12hrs00.  Sunny day, 5 C.

2020-01-17 Tip weight including stand 15.5 kg, not seen on candy.

2019-12-23 Apibioxal oxalic acid treatment using the trickle method.  The was a bit of mould in the top of the hive.  They were feed quite late so I guess it was damp at the end of the season.

2019-11-03 Took off the Apivar.

2019-09-21 Put on 2 strips of Apivar (from VÃ©to-pharma), comes off in 6 to 10 weeks.

2019-09-14 Took the MAQS off, no longer stinky.  Saw the queen but she was not laying, possibly because of the MAQS or maybe because I have been feeding them.

2019-09-07 Put on MAQS boy that stuff stinks.

2019-09-07 Lots of brood, saw the new queen, seems that I was wrong.

2019-08-23 No brood, queen definitely swarmed.  Needs a new queen or to get united with another colony. They have been queenless for only 3 weeks so there is no hurry.

2019-08-03 Found a few sealed queen cells and the queen.  We haven't got the equipment for an artificial swarm, so took down the queen cells and reversed the brood boxes.  It is late in the season and I am hoping this my stop the process.  Probably good to take a look in a few days time.  They weren't using all the brood frames so I reduced them to 9 x 9.  Put on a super with frames that had crystallized comb cut out of them, so they have some space and something to work on.

2019-07-18 No signs of swarming.  Saw eggs but not the queen.

2019-07-14 Added two brood frames bring them up to 20.

2019-07-13  Saw the queen and marked her yellow. No signs of swarming.  Need more space, there are a lot of bees in there.

2019-07-07 Put on another empty super to give them something to work on.  Added two brood frames to bring them up to 18 frames.

2019-07-06 Looked for the queen but couldn't find her.  No signs of swarming but lots of bees, needs another super and a couple more brood frames.

2019-06-30 Took off the messed up brood frames that had drones laid in them and distributed them to the other hives.

2019-06-28 Saw brood and eggs.  There are rubbish brood frames that had drone laying workers on them.

2019-06-22 Saw eggs but didn't see the queen.  Not a lot of stores so I put on a feeder.

2019-06-02 Plenty of eggs, no obvious signs of queen production but there were some queen cups.  They are drawing out the frames I put in and there are a lot of bees.  I think it might be a good idea to swap them to the other side of the production hive.

2019-05-25 Put on 6 more frames and reconfigured to 8 x 8.

2019-05-23 Lots of bees, lots of stores, no place for the queen to lay.  Maybe more frame or try and bleed off some bee.

2019-05-11 Lots of bees, moved to the other side to bleed some off.

2019-04-25 Found charged queen cells so took the queen and moved her to one side.  The charged queen cells are on the original site ([Greta]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2019-greta.html)).

2019-04-18 No signs of swarming but loads of bees, added another super.

2019-04-07 Added a super.

2019-04-06 Lots of bees, brood on about 60% of the frames, saw eggs, the drone culling area was ready so I culled it.

2018-09-24 Apiguard off.  Supers on for drying.

2018-08-11 Apiguard on.

2018-08-09 Added frames from [Teresa]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2019-teresa.html) (which had a laying worker).

2018-08-06 Laying queen, doing well.

2018-06-30 Mags culled the queen cells down to one.  Don't know if the frame was marked with a pin.

2018-06-23 Found a couple of charged queen cells in [Sarah]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2017-sarah.html) so created this colony.
