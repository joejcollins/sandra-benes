## 2020 Queenless?

2022-03-26 Dead, didn't make it.

2021-12-20 API-Bioxal (oxalic acid treatment), the bees were all in the top brood box.  Put on a block of candy.

2021-09-24 The queen cell at the bottom of the frame with the blue pin broke open when I removed the frame to look.  There was a queen cell with a grub at the bottom of the second? frame from the East (marked with a yellow pin).  Along side it were some drone cells with brood in, but no eggs.  Can they have transferred the eggs?  I added another frame of brood and eggs marked with a black pin (sixth or seventh from the East).  Generally the bees are well behaved and quiet on the frames, not behaving in an overtly queenless way.

2021-09-21 There's a charged queen cell at the bottom of the frame in the middle and marked with a blue pin.  It is not an emergency cell.

2021-09-18 Put in a frame with grubs and brood (in the top box) marked with a blue pin to see if they will make a queen cell.

2021-09-17 No signs of a laying queen.  I think the MAQS strips might have killed her off.

2021-09-06 Took off the MAQS and started feeding again.  There were a worrying number of dead bees on top of one of the MAQS strips (like the acid came out too fast and killed a load?).

2021-08-30 Put the MAQS strips on between the two brood boxes.

2021-08-20 Saw eggs and grubs didn't see the queen.  No signs of swarming but there are a lot of bees so I added a super.

2021-08-08 I saw eggs in the top brood box, it was windy so I didn't look in the bottom box.  Didn't see the queen.

2021-08-01 I saw eggs in the top brood box and sealed brood in the bottom box.  Didn't see the queen.

2021-07-25 Removed a frame of eggs and donated them to [Whitney]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2021-whitney.html) to suppress laying workers.

2021-07-23 I saw eggs but didn't see the queen.  Lots of brood.  No signs of swarming.

2021-07-14 I saw eggs but didn't see the queen.  No signs of swarming.

2021-07-08 I saw eggs but didn't see the queen.  No signs of swarming but lots of brood.

2021-07-01 I saw eggs and saw the queen.  Lots of brood.

2021-06-26 I saw eggs but didn't see the queen.  No signs of swarming but lots of brood.

2021-06-18 I saw eggs but didn't see the queen.

2021-06-12 I saw eggs but didn't see the queen.  There is not much brood but there are a lot of flying bees.

2021-06-09 Added flying bees and frames from [Wendy]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2021-wendy.html) which was destroyed because of a drone laying queen or worker.

2021-06-05 Saw charged queen cells, so removed to side made up [Whitney]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2021-whitney.html).

2021-05-27 Saw brood, eggs and the queen.  Some cups but no signs of swarming. Most of the honey in the supers has gone.

2021-05-22 Saw brood, eggs but didn't see the queen.  Some cups but no signs of swarming.  The supers are getting full so I put on another one.

2021-05-14 Saw brood, eggs, drones, drone comb but didn't see the queen.  No signs of swarming.  Shed loads of workers and plenty of drones.

2021-05-07 Saw brood, eggs, drones, drone comb but didn't see the queen.  No signs of swarming.  Shed loads of bees.

2021-04-30 Saw brood, eggs, drones, drone comb but didn't see the queen.  No signs of swarming.

2021-04-24 Saw brood, eggs, drones, drone comb and the queen.  The queen was unmarked (rubbed off or new queen?) so remarked her with yellow.

2021-04-18 Brood, eggs, drones, drone comb, didn't see the queen, queen cups.  Lots of bees so I put on two supers.

2021-03-31 Brood in the top and bottom boxes.  About 5 frames of sealed brood, 3 frames of unsealed, some drone cells.  Didn't see the queen.  Nectar coming in.  A lot of propolis.

2020-12-25 API-Bioxal (oxalic acid treatment).

2020-10-06 Looks like they have stopped feeding, so took the rapid feeder off.

2020-09-19 Apiguard treatment off.

2020-08-22 Second Apiguard treatment.

2020-08-08 Started Apiguard treatment.

2020-08-04 Found one unsealed queen cell which I took down.  Reconfigured so the brood is in the bottom box and added a feeder.

2020-08-03 Removed the supers.

2020-08-01 Sealed queen cell and about 5 unsealed, queen still present and laying.  Strange, I think the queen cell might be some artifact because a couple of the frames were from a laying worker colony.  Also I can't be doing with a Demaree right now so I just took down the cells. Added brood box and more frames underneath.  Put on the clearer board so I can take the supers off.  Once those are off I can start feeding so the frames can be drawn out.

2020-07-24 Saw the queen, grubs and eggs.  It is a bit confused because there are a couple of droney combs from [Brenda]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2020-brenda.html) in there.

2020-07-19 Added frames and flying bees from [Brenda]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2020-brenda.html).

2020-07-17 Saw queen cells and eggs, had to hunt for the queen.  Marked her and put her in another box (on a Snelgrove board) on top of [Brenda]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2020-brenda.html).  If Brenda doesn't come good I will merge them.  Actually I might merge them anyway.

2020-07-10 Lots of brood.  Saw eggs but didn't see the queen.  There are a lot of bees in there.

2020-06-30 Lots of normal brood and grubs.  I didn't see eggs but I wasn't looking that hard and was just pleased that the brood looked normal.  Didn't see the queen.  There are a lot of bees and not much honey, I was going to shuffle the honey supers but the one that was full is now, not so full.

2020-06-23 Checked for a laying queen, saw eggs at the bottom of cells on frame 5 from the South.  I am not supposed to check for another week so this check is too early really.  Can't be certain things are right, but the eggs were singles at the bottom of the cells.

2020-05-27 Culled the queen cells down to one on the South face of a frame, second from the North end.  Marked with a pin.

2020-05-20 Made up with 11 frames from [Georgia]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2019-georgia.html).  Marked two queen cells one on the bottom of a frame and one on the southern face of another frame.
