## 2022 Marked Queen

2024-09-22 Sold.

2024-08-09 About 9 frames of bees, looking good.  Saleable.

2024-08-02 Swopped position with [Gabrielle]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2024-gabrielle.html) so I can reduce the number of bees and remove the super.

2024-07-27 Saw eggs, grubs and sealed brood.  Didn't see the queen.  There is space in the super and it is going to be hot next week so I left it on.

2024-07-19 Saw eggs, grubs and sealed brood.  Didn't see the queen. The brood box is pretty full of bees and the super is being used.  Double brood or another super?

2024-07-14 Saw eggs, grubs, sealed brood and the queen.  She is marked but it is wearing off.  They aren't really using the super so could be squeezed down for sale if need be.

2024-07-07 Saw eggs, grubs and sealed brood.  Didn't see the queen, all bar one or the 10 frames is in use.  They are back filling a bit so probably need more space.  So I put in the eleventh brood frame and put on a super.

2024-06-19 Saw eggs, grubs and sealed brood.  Found a charged queen cell and there is backfilling going on so I decided to do a preemptive split and created [Gwendolyn]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2024-gwendolyn.html).  Put a feeder on because she will loose the flying bees.

2024-06-01 Saw eggs but didn't see the queen, plenty of space.

2024-05-19 There aren't too many bees and there is plenty of of space in the super.  Didn't bother looking in the brood box.

2024-05-11 Saw eggs but didn't see the queen.

2024-05-04 No explicit signs of swarming, the weather has been cold and rainy.  However they are starting to backfill the brood chamber so I did a preemptive split and created [Gwen]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2024-gwen.html).  I culled the drone cells on the cull frame as part of the process..

2024-04-26 Saw eggs and brood, didn't see the queen. Only a few of the cells on the drone cull frame are sealed. There were plenty of bees so I added a super.

2024-04-20 Saw eggs and brood, didn't see the queen.  No signs of swarming but both boxes are very busy.  When the feeder runs out I should probably put a super on.

2024-04-11 About 12 frames of brood mostly in the bottom box.  Didn't see the queen, but saw eggs and brood.  The bees are on the candy.

2023-12-21 Put on a candy block.

2023-09-23 Apiguard varroa treatment off.

2023-08-25 Second Apiguard varroa treatment.

2023-08-12 Started Apiguard treatment.

2023-07-29 There aren't a great deal of stores considering how much they have been fed lately but it has been raining a lot.  Four frames of brood in the top brood box, saw the queen in the bottom box.  There was a single charge queen cup (which I took down) otherwise no signs of swarming.

2023-07-22 They are drawing out the frames in the top box.  No signs of swarming but I didn't look in the top box.

2023-07-17 Added flying bees from [Rita]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2023-rita.html).

2023-07-09 The top brood box isn't being draw, they are just putting syrup in the brood chamber so that is a waste of time.  I might try and increase the flying bees by taking some from [Rita]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2023-rita.html).

2023-07-04 Moved to a new position and added 9 undrawn brood frames so now there are 10 brood frames in the bottom and 9 on top.  I also shook in 6 frames of bees from the original site.  Since there are no supers I put on a feeder to help them draw the undrawn frames.  Left [Regina]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2023-regina.html) in place with 10 frames to raise a new queen.

2023-07-01 Eggs, grubs didn't see the queen.  Some queen cups.  Too many bees.  Needs splitting so we can treat the bees in August.

2023-06-22 Only went through the top brood box.  Saw grubs, eggs and the queen.  There are some cups (one with egg an egg in it) but no other signs of swarming.  One of the supers was quite full so we put in on top ready to be cleared.

2023-06-16 Saw eggs, grubs and the queen.  Remarked the queen yellow because the mark was wearing off.  She was looking into cells at the time checking out places to lay.  The supers all seem to be in use so put another one on.

2023-06-10 Saw eggs, grubs and the queen.  Added 2 more brood frames so they are now 10 on 10 with a dummy board in each brood box.  One of the supers is pretty heavy and the one from yesterday is light (unsurprisingly).  An extra super wouldn't hurt, the weather is very warm and they still seem to be bringing in nectar.

2023-06-09 Added another super because they seem very busy.  Probably going to need more brood frames as well soon.

2023-06-03 Saw grubs and eggs, didn't see the queen. About 14 of the 18 frames have brood on.  There is nectar coming in to the super but the outer frames don't have any nectar.  Nicely behaved.

2023-05-27 Saw grubs and eggs, didn't see the queen.  They are making drone cells and seem pushed for space to I added a super.

2023-05-21 Saw grubs, eggs and the queen.  No signs of swarming but lots of bees and brood so I added 2 more frames.  Now on 9 x 9 F.

2023-05-18 Saw grubs and eggs, but didn't see the queen.  No signs of swarming.  Bees on all the frames, so I swapped the location to bleed off some bees and added 5 more brood frames.  Now on a 8 x 8 double brood.

2023-05-07 Saw grubs and eggs and the queen.  No signs of swarming.  Bees on 5 or 6 frames.

2023-04-30 Removed to one side on 11 frames and made up [Rebecca]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2023-rebecca.html) with most of the brood frames to raise a new queen.

2023-04-29 Queen cells with eggs in.

2023-04-19 Swapped position with [Yasmin]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2022-yasmin.html) to balance the flying bees.

2023-04-15 There are 11 frames of brood, saw eggs, didn't see the queen.

2023-03-16 About a third of the candy is still there, never-the-less I put on a feeder.  Ominously quiet, but it is wet and about 10 C and the other hives were quiet too.  Didn't look inside.

2023-03-02 Half the candy still there.

2023-02-18 Most of the candy still there.

2023-01-02 API-Bioxal (oxalic acid treatment) and candy block.

2022-09-18 Took off the Apiguard treatment.

2022-08-19 Second Apiguard treatment on.

2022-08-06 Started Apiguard treatment.

2022-07-26 Took off the cleared supers, added frames to bring them up to 11 x 11 and put on a feeder.

2022-07-24 Added two frames to make them up to 10 x 10.  Also put on the clearer board.

2022-07-23 Saw eggs and brood, didn't see the queen no signs of swarming.  The new super frames are not being drawn.  They can probably be squeezed down into the brood with another two frames.

2022-07-19 Removed a cleared super.

2022-07-16 Saw eggs, brood and the marked queen.  Two of the supers were heavy so I put a clearer board on to clear one.  The third super has undrawn frames so put this close to the brood chamber for them to draw out.

2022-07-12 Removed the cleared super, put another one on to replace it.

2022-07-09 The top super is pretty heavy so I put on a clearer board so I can extract it.

2022-07-08 Expanded the brood box to 9 x 9 frames.  The top super is getting heavier, so could come off soon.

2022-07-08 Lots of brood.  Found the new queen and marked her.  There is lots of brood and they are back filling so they need more space, another brood chamber I think.

2022-06-17 Lots of bees on the front of the hive, appearing to be fanning.  Mating perhaps?  It was very warm.

2022-06-13 Removed the cleared supers.

2022-06-10 Put on a clearer board to clear the two heaviest supers.  The other supers are pretty light so they don't have a lot of stores.

2022-06-04 Culled down to a single queen cell on the bottom of frame 5 (counting from the south) marked with a white pin.  We checked all the frames and really couldn't see any queen cells.  It is 7 days since the queen was removed.  Perhaps we should be checking at 8 days?  Maybe but it is raining tomorrow so we can't.

2022-05-28 Made up with 11 frames of brood from [Whitney]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2021-whitney.html).
