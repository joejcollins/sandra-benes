## 2021 Marked Queen

2023-04-18 Sold.

2023-04-15 There are 15 frames of brood, saw eggs, didn't see the queen, lots of drones.

2023-03-02 Candy all gone so I put on a feeder.

2023-02-18 Half the candy still there.

2023-01-02 API-Bioxal (oxalic acid treatment) and candy block.

2022-09-18 Took off the Apiguard treatment.  Put on a clearer board.

2022-08-26 No laying in the super.  Removed the top super which wasn't getting worked on.

2022-08-19 Second Apiguard treatment on.  I messed up by briefly putting the super on the brood box without the queen excluder, I will need to check for laying in the supers.

2022-08-06 Started Apiguard treatment, but left the supers on because there are so many bees.

2022-07-30 Put on a clearer and an super with undrawn frames.  The full super needs to come off but there are a lot of bees hence the extra super.

2022-07-28 Removed the clearer super.

2022-07-26 Added 5 more brood frames to bring them up to 11 x 11.  They seem pretty pissed off but the weather isn't that good.  Put a clearer board on.

2022-07-23 Saw eggs and brood, didn't see the queen no signs of swarming. Still pretty busy the new super frames were drawn a bit but I am not sure that they are still doing it.  The two other supers are full and could be removed.  If they are to be squeezed into the brood they will need another 5 brood frames.

2022-07-16 Saw eggs and brood, but didn't see the queen. No signs of swarming. Added another super because it looked so busy.

2022-07-10 Added another super with 11 frames of starter strips.

2022-07-09 Saw eggs and brood, but didn't see the queen. The supers are heavy and busy so I added a empty one above the brood chamber.  The top two heavy ones could be removed but I have not supers to replace them with right now.

2022-07-01 Saw eggs and brood, but didn't see the queen. They have plenty of space in the supers.  No signs of swarming.

2022-06-23 Saw eggs and brood, but didn't see the queen. Pretty busy still so I added another super.

2022-06-21 Moved to the other side of [Yasmin]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2022-yasmin.html) to bleed off some bees.

2022-06-17 Saw eggs and brood, but didn't see the queen.  No signs of swarming.  Removed the feeder.

2022-06-10 Eggs and brood in the top box, no signs of swarming.  It looks like they have enough space.  Also they probably have enough food so I can remove the feeder.

2022-06-04 Plenty of eggs, brood and bees.  Converted to a double brood and put on a feeder.

2022-05-28 Saw eggs and saw the queen, no signs of swarming, light on stores still so refilled the feeder.

2022-05-21 Saw eggs and grubs but didn't see the queen, they are a bit light on stores so I put on a feeder.

2022-05-14 Very busy, back filling, some uncharged queen cups.  There were drones and a whole lot of brood to come out so I decided to do a preemptive split and made up [Yasmin]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2022-yasmin.html) on the original site.

2022-05-05 Very busy, removed entrance block and added a super.  No signs of swarming.  Saw the queen, she looked fine.

2022-04-30 Plenty of bees and drones, no signs of swarming, some empty queen cups.

2022-04-24 Plenty of bees, put on another super.  There was a section of drone brood, about half a frame.  A few queen cups and there might have been a tiny bit of back filling.

2022-04-14 Half hearted inspection, we seemed to be breaking drone comb.  Lots of bees so I put on a super.

2022-03-26 Marked the queen.  Lots of bees, about 8 frames with brood on.  Half of one frame was drone brood.  A good balance of stores, but not enough for more than a week of bad weather in my opinion.

2021-12-20 API-Bioxal (oxalic acid treatment), the bees were in the middle between the top and bottom brood boxes.  Put on a block of candy.

2021-09-17 Brood and grubs will assume that the queen is good.  Plenty of food.

2021-09-06 Took off the MAQS and started feeding again.

2021-08-30 Put the MAQS strips on between the two brood boxes.

2021-08-22 Added another brood box because I want to balance the flying bees with [Bethany]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2020-bethany.html).

2021-08-20 Saw eggs and brood, still couldn't find the queen to mark her.

2021-08-09 Saw eggs and brood.

2021-08-01 Saw eggs and brood.  Added a couple more frames.

2021-07-26 Added two more drawn frames to give the queen more space to lay in.

2021-07-25 There was a bit of shit on the front of the hive so I thought they might have dysentery.  Saw eggs so probably has a laying queen.  No signs of dysentery.  They probably need feeding and a couple more frames.

2021-07-14 There was an additional emergency queen cell, so I culled it.

2021-07-11 I still think that there may be an emerged queen in here so I took out this sealed queen cell and put it in another location (beside [Whitney]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2021-whitney.html)).  I shook off one frame of bees and added another frame with minimal brood on it then added three frames with new foundation and a feeder.  The plan it is attempt to mate this queen in the event that the supposed emerged queen (designated [Winona]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2021-winona.html)) isn't there or fails to mate.

2021-07-08 Made up with 11 frames of brood from [Berenice]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2020-berenice.html).   One sealed queen cell on the top north face of the middle frame, marked with a blue pin.
