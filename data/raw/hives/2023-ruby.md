## 2023 Queen Unmarked

2024-04-27 Sold.

2024-04-23 Reduced to 11 frames and transferred the frames into the buyers box.

2024-04-20 Saw eggs and brood, didn't see the queen. Marked the frames to be sold with white ends, 2 frames in the top box and 9 frames from the bottom box.

2024-04-11 Plenty of stores and a bunch of dead bees on the floor.  This colony was the last to mate last year, so a lot of the bees would have been older bees at that point.  The were only about 4 frames of brood in the bottom box to the north.  The laying pattern wasn't super and I didn't see the queen, but there was eggs and brood.

2023-12-21 Put on a candy block.

2023-09-23 Apiguard varroa treatment off.

2023-08-25 Second Apiguard varroa treatment.

2023-08-13 Started Apiguard treatment.

2023-08-12 Added another brood box and cleared the supers.

2023-08-09 Small patch of grubs and eggs.  Eggs in bottom of cells.  It appears normal.  Too many bees to squeeze down into a single box.

2023-07-16 Culled down to one queen cell on bottom of middle frame. Marked with a white pin.

2023-07-09 Made up with 10 frames of brood from [Rebecca]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2023-rebecca.html).
