## 2015 Queen

23/12/2015 Oxalic acid treatment.  Calm.

24/9/2015 Removed apiguard treatment.

12/8/2015 Put on the first Apiguard treatment.  There were a lot of dead bees outside.  I think I merged them too early because I was going out and didn't let the colony settle after I removed the queen.

10/8/2015  Removed the last super.  Merged with [Sally]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2015-sally.html) on top.

9/8/2015 Saw eggs, but didn't see the queen.  Put on a clearer board to clear the last super.

6/8/2015 Couldn't see any signs of a queen, so I took a frame of eggs from [Bella]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2015-bella.html) and put them in at F5 to see what they would do.

2/8/2015 One of the queen cells that I left had emerged.  The other cells appeared to have been opened on the sides indicating the emerged queen might have killed the queens in the cells.  There are no eggs, so I must assume that the colony swarmed and there might be an unmated queen in there.

17/7/2015 Saw eggs and grubs but didn't look for the queen.  There were two sealed queen cells of the bottom of F5 and two sealed queen cells on F6 (one on the face and one on the bottom).  Since they are all sealed I cannot tell the age.  If there were attempting to supersede 10 days ago (and 5 days ago (when I last visited).  Then these cells would have been in production last time I looked.  I could take them down since I have a laying queen in [Clare]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2014-clare.html).

12/7/2014 Saw the queen (the marking has come off) and eggs.  There is one sealed queen cell on the face of a frame (which I took down).  I reflection they were probably trying to supercede (1-3 cells on face of same frame, all the same age). Swarm cells are on the edges and in gaps and different ages.  Anyway I stuffed that up.

7/7/2014 Some preparation for swarming (2 charged cells).  I took the queen cells down and put on another super.

30/6/2015 The seemed busy today so I checked again.  All is well.  They appear to have sufficient space.

23/6/2015 Saw queen, eggs and brood.  Marked the queen.  Looks clean and healthy.  Covering about 11 frames.  Probably needs a bit more space or some the of bees removing.  I put on a super to give them more space.

4/6/2015 Saw eggs and brood.  Looks clean and healthy.  Covering about 9 frames.

23/5/2015 Laying eggs and making comb.

21/5/2015 Collected from Tony in All Stretton.
