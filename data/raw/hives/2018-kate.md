## 2018 Queen Marked

2020-07-10 Sealed queen cells, saw a virgin queen, looks like they might have swarmed.  I must have missed the queen cells in the last inspection (because I wasn't looking for them, I was intend on confirming that the queen was laying.  Also I had been feeding them quite a bit).   Not a lot of stores.  Sold with the queen cells and everything.

2020-07-02 Saw eggs, grubs and the queen.  Lots of bees on 9 frames, the two end frames aren't drawn yet so I put on a feeder to help them drawn the frames out.

2020-05-26 Saw eggs but didn't see the queen.  No queen cells.

2020-05-19 Removed queen excluder from under hive.  Lots of dead drones on it, so I was too late and it is probably not even necessary.  I won't bother next time.

2020-05-15 Removed the grass from the entrance.

2020-05-14 Saw eggs, brood and charged queen cells.  Removed to a the South with one frame of brood and the other frames stores.  Grass in the entrance and queen excluder underneath.  Not sure about the merit of doing both.

2020-05-02 Saw the queen, eggs and brood. There were drones and there were only a couple of patches of eggs in the 22 frames.  There were a few cups and one charged cell.  No queen cells with grubs.  Put on a honey super, with 3 frames which need drawing.

2019-08-15 Added second Apiguard treatment.

2019-08-03 Saw the queen laying nicely, tidy brood pattern.  No signs of swarming.  They weren't using all the brood frames so I reduced them to 9 x 9.  Started the Apiguard treatment.

2019-07-22 Saw the queen and eggs.  Added another brood box from [Greta]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2019-greta.html) which was queenless.

2019-07-18 Open lower door on Snelgrove.

2019-07-14 Saw the queen and marked her, she is kind of small.  Put [Greta]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2019-greta.html) on top with a Snelgrove board between with a view to merging them at some point.

2019-07-13 Pissed off, but plenty of eggs and brood.  Didn't see the queen.  They need more space so I added 2 brood frames.  Put on a crystallized super to get them to eat the crystals.

2019-07-06 Found charged queen cells so took the queen and moved her to one side.  The charged queen cells are on the original site ([Georgia]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2019-georgia.html)).

2019-05-25 Put on 4 more frames and reconfigured to 7 x 7.

2019-05-23 Lots of bees, lots of stores, no place for the queen to lay.  Maybe more frame or try and bleed off some bee.

2019-04-25 Found charged queen cells so took the queen and moved her to one side.  The charged queen cells are on the original site ([Gina]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2019-gina.html)).

2018-08-11 Apiguard on.

2018-07-23 Checked and confirmed that the queen is laying.

2018-06-25 This lot swarmed.  I checked and there were other sealed queen cells which I culled (missed them first time round).  Still leaving the queen cell on bottom of frame 5 from the North.  Marked with a blue pin.

2018-06-21 Sealed queen cell on bottom of frame 5 from the North.  Marked with a blue pin.

2018-06-13  Culled the spare queen cells and a close pair of queen cells on the bottom of the middle frame.  One was charged and the other smaller one wasn't.  Marked with a blue pin.

2018-06-07 There were emergency cells on the frames that I moved over from [Teresa]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2019-teresa.html).  I shook the frames and took the emergency cells down.  Then put in a frame with eggs from [Teresa]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2019-teresa.html).  The eggs are on the North side of the centre frame, for future reference.

2018-05-31 Queen cell has emerged.  Removed 3 empty frames and put them in [Teresa]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2019-teresa.html).  The frames of brood and went in at positions 5, 6 and 7.

2018-05-23 Only checked the supers which are getting full so I think they will need a fourth one.

2018-05-17 Culled the queen cells.  Left a single cell at the top of the frame North of the cull frame.  Marked with a red pin.  I am guessing we are at about day 8 so day 23 is 2018-06-01.  So I should check for eggs after that.

2018-05-10 Made up with 11 frames from [Teresa]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2019-teresa.html).  Single queen cells with eggs marked with red, black and white pins.  A frame with a row of queen cells on the bottom marked with a blue pin
