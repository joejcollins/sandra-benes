## 2018 Queen

2019-05-19 Jo came and took the bees, so the comb exchange took about a month, feeding them pretty much all the time.

2019-04-18 Prepared for Bailey comb exchange on to 12 x 14 size frames.  Marked the queen yellow.

2019-04-07 Lots of bees, brood on about 60% of the frames, saw eggs.  Broke the end of one of the frames in the top box so that will need replacing.  The frames had quite a few drones on.  Possibly because there is no drone cull area.  Not sure about that.  There were eggs but I am wondering if the queen is good, it was made from an emergency cell.  Mmmm.

2018-09-24 Apiguard off.  Supers on for drying.

2018-08-11 Apiguard on.

2018-08-09 United with [Sarah]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2017-sarah.html).

2018-08-6 Laying queen.

2018-07-14 Emergency cells on the frame of brood, so I culled down to one cell and marked the frame with a blue pin.  Assume that the queen will emerge on 19 July so check on 9 August.

2018-07-08 There was a swarm which is suspect came from this hive.  My theory is that putting in the eggs so early allow the new queen to swarm.

2018-07-07 No signs of a laying queen and they seem a bit agitated.  I transfered eggs in from [Sarah]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2017-sarah.html) to test if they have a queen.  Marked the frame with a blue pin.

2018-06-21 Sealed queen cell on bottom of middle frame.  Marked with a blue pin.

2018-06-13 [Teresa]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2019-teresa.html) had a couple of queen cells that were charged so I removed her to another location and marked the frame with the queen cells with a blue pin.
