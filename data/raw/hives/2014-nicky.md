## White Marked 2014 Queen

15/4/2015 Sold to Jim.

5/4/2015 Saw some eggs, a few grubs and bit of brood on 2 frames.  A couple of frames of food. Didn't see the queen. Left on the candy block.  The whole thing is about the size of a nuc.  Could do with a bit of a stimulative feed.

25/12/2014 Oxalic acid treatment.  There were 5 seams of bees (medium size colony) in the bottom box towards the North side.  Plenty of weight in the top box.  Put on candy block.

11/8/2014 Put on the first Apiguard treatment.

6/8/2013 Merged with [Jill]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2013-jill.html).

4/8/2013 Saw the queen and remarked her.  Still laying.

31/7/2014 Place to one side of  [Jill]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2013-jill.html) because I couldn't find the queen and wanted to bleed off the bees into [Jill]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2013-jill.html) so I could find her.

30/7/2014 Saw eggs but didn't see the queen.  Didn't like their behaviour, they were all over my hands and generally running about.

23/7/2014  I was right there is a laying queen in the top hive, designated the top hive [Jill]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2013-jill.html).

14/7/2014 Tried joining them and they started buzzing bad.  Nervous that there maybe a queen in the top colony.  So I configured it with two separate colonies.  One on top of the other.  Both with supers and a queen excluder, separated by a Snelgrove board.  If there is only one queen they are together.  If there are two queens it will work a bit like a Demaree.

10/7/2014 Joined (using Snelgrove board) with [Alison]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2014-alison.html), because Alison swarmed off.

Saw brood, eggs and the queen.  A couple of cells has two eggs in.  Not enough cells perhaps?  I didn't see any signs of a laying worker (no drones in brood cells, no eggs on sides of cells and the pattern doesn't look that bad considering the disturbance they have had).

30/6/2014 Saw brood and eggs, but didn't see the queen.  Put on a contact feeder incase they need some extra feed.

21/6/2014 White marked queen is still there, bees only covering three frames.

20/6/2014 They seemed to swarm after we finished, so we grabbed the swarm (it was tiny) and put it in the hive.

20/6/2014 The marking on the queen has gone to remarked with white (I think it is a better colour and Ray doesn't have any green pens).  There were signs of swarming so split off leaving a queen cell in [Alison]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2014-alison.html) using the Celia Davies method.

12/6/2014 Lots of brood.  Some frames undrawn so kept feeding.

5/6/2014 Put on a clearer board so I can put on a feeder and get them to draw the second brood box.

26/5/2014 Saw eggs but didn't see the queen.  Removed a frame of eggs to put in [Fran]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2014-fran.html).

20/5/2014 Added another brood box, increasing frames from 11 to 16.

18/5/2014 Full of brood and bees.  Added a super.

9/5/2014 Added two frames, no signs of swarming but only looked at central frame.

3/5/2014 Queen laying, marked red, added frames to make up to 9.  Quiet on the frame, but light coloured bees.

26/4/2014 On 5 frames, treated with oxalic acid.  Very calm and placid.

24/4/2014 Good looking swarm collected from Pitchford.
