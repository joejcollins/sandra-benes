## Opened Queen Cell

2021-06-09 Drone laying queen or worker.  There were even a few laid up cells in the super.  The eggs were at the bottom of the cells so I assume it was a drone laying queen.  The weather for mating was terrible so I guess it isn't surprising.  I took off the supers and shook all the bees out in the top of the field.   All the frames and flying bees went into [Bethany]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2020-bethany.html).

2021-06-05 Checked for a mated queen.  No sign of laying queen but there were some polished cells.  They seemed a bit tetchy to me.  Added a frame with eggs from [Berenice]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2020-berenice.html) to see if they will make emergency cells.

2021-05-01 The queen cell on the bottom of the middle frame had recently popped, there was a little door on it.  There were shed loads of bees and another 10 or so queen cells.  One of the queen cells had been gashing in the side.  I am guessing that the new queen is still in there and it not ready to fly yet.  I took down all the queen cells in the hope she will mate from this hive.

2021-04-24 Made up with 11 frames of brood from [Berenice]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2020-berenice.html).   Two unsealed queen cells on the bottom of the middle frame, marked with a red pin.
