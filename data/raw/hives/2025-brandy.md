## 2025 Queen

2025-09-06 Apiguard tray two on.

2025-08-25 Put on a patty of MegaBee (which was made up from 50 g of MegaBee powder and thick syrup).  Also put on a 330 g of Candipolline Gold to see if they would like that too.  Also added thick syrup in a bowl and straw feeder.

2025-08-22 Apiguard on, 10 days late.

2025-08-22 Varroa slide out.  Count 150.  The slide was in for 5 days not 7, so the daily count is 30.  The National Bee unit say that May to August: Multiply by 30.  Giving 900.  Treatment must happen before you reach 1000.

2025-08-17 Put in the varroa slide.

2025-08-16 Some eggs and brood in the top box.  Empty cells in the bottom box.  Didn't see the queen.  The have eaten/removed about a third of the patty.  There is plenty of yellow dust under the hive so it could be either or both.

2025-08-13 Put on a patty of MegaBee (which was made up from 125 g of MegaBee powder and thick syrup).

2025-08-09 Some brood in all stages but not that much.

2027-07-21 Checked for laying queen.  Loads of brood, grubs and eggs.

2025-07-05 Reduced the entrance because there are lots of wasps around.

2025-06-22 Culled down to one queen cell on the South face on the third frame from the North, marked with a blue pin.

2025-06-21 Can't find the queen, lots of back filling, 4 queen cells in the bottom box.  She might have flown yesterday or the day before.  Anyway there is not a lot of space so they need another 3 frames.  I can cull the cells down and put the frames in tomorrow.

2025-06-13 Saw eggs no signs of swarming, there are eggs in the top brood box now.  Left the feeder on.

2025-06-06 Didn't see the queen but there were eggs and plenty of brood.  Leave with the feeder on.

2025-05-30 They are not drawing the brood frames so I removed the super and put on a feeder.

2025-05-23 Still laying in the bottom box, they haven't draw the frames in th second brood box, but there are cells due to come out so soon there should be house bees to draw the frames.

2025-05-13 Saw the queen, brood and eggs.  Added another super because it is so warm and there are so many bees.  Could probably do with another brood box.

2025-05-02 Queen is laying so marked her yellow.

2025-04-30 Added more frames because they seem quite busy.  Saw the queen.

2025-04-28 Cast collected from the Batch.
