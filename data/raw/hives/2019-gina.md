## 2019 Queen ?

2019-06-27 Definitely a laying worker.

2019-06-22 Marked with a green pin, laying worker?

2019-06-14 Still no signs of laying or anything.  Still put in a frame with eggs from [Sonja]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2018-sonja.html) at frame 6.

2019-06-06 No signs of laying or anything.  I couldn't find the queen cell so I removed the pin.  The brood frame had cleaned cells and pollen so I am inclined to leave it another week and see what happens.  If there is nothing I will take frames from [Sonja]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2018-sonja.html).

2019-05-02 Culled the queen cells leaving one on the North side of the cull frame, marked with a white pin.  There weren't that many queen cells, say 20.

2019-04-25 Charged queen cells and flying bees from [Kate]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2018-kate.html).
