## 2022 Marked Queen

2023-06-10 Sold.

2023-06-03 Saw grubs and eggs, didn't see the queen. About 14 of the 18 frames have brood on.  There is nectar coming in to the super but the outer frames don't have any nectar.  A bit agitated and tending to get all over my gloves.

2023-05-27 Saw grubs and eggs, didn't see the queen.  They are making drone cells and seem pushed for space to I added two more brood frames and a super.  The weather is very good and I have a feeling they may be thinking about swarming next week.

2023-05-20 Saw grubs and eggs, didn't see the queen.  No signs of swarming.  Bees on all frames so I put in another 5 and configured it for 8 x 8 frames.

2023-05-18 Saw grubs, eggs, and the queen.  No signs of swarming.  Bees on 8-9 frames.

2023-05-07 Saw grubs and eggs, didn't see the queen.  No signs of swarming.  Bees on 5 or 6 frames.

2023-04-29 Queen cells with eggs in.  Removed to one side on 11 frames and made up [Rita]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2023-rita.html) with most of the brood frames to raise a new queen.

2023-04-19 Swapped position with [Yvette]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2022-yvette.html) to balance the flying bees.

2023-04-15 There are 11 frames of brood, saw eggs, didn't see the queen.

2023-02-18 Candy all gone so I put on a feeder.

2023-01-02 API-Bioxal (oxalic acid treatment) and candy block.

2022-09-18 Took off the Apiguard treatment.

2022-08-19 Second Apiguard treatment on.

2022-08-06 Started Apiguard treatment.

2022-07-26 Took off the cleared supers and put on a feeder.  There is plenty of space on the 10 x 10 that they have.  They seem pretty pissed off but the weather isn't that good.

2022-07-23 Added 4 frames and put a clearer board on to clear the super.

2022-07-23 Saw eggs and brood, didn't see the queen no signs of swarming. They don't appear to be working the super, with another 4 frames to make them into 10 x 10 they could be squeezed on to the brood boxes.

2022-07-16 Found and marked the queen.  There no signs of swarming but the single brood box was looking cramped, so we put them on double brood.

2022-07-12 Removed the cleared super.

2022-07-09 Saw eggs and brood, but didn't see the queen. I want to mark her.  One of the supers was heavy so I put on a clearer board.

2022-06-21 Saw eggs and brood, not sealed yet.  There weren't sufficient bees for the three supers so I'll feed in some bees from from [Winnie]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2021-winnie.html).

2022-06-06 Remove the cleared supers, leaving them with three supers.

2022-06-04 Masses of bees despite the fact that they appeared to swarm on 2022-06-02.  Two of the supers are full so I put on an empty super and a clearer board to clear the full supers.  Didn't look in the brood chamber.

2022-05-21 Culled down to a single queen cell on the north side of frame 4 counting from the south.  Marked with a white pin.

2022-05-14 Made up with 11 frames of brood from [Winnie]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2021-winnie.html).
