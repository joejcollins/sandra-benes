## Unmarked 2013 Queen

20/4/2014 Destroyed by throwing the bees in the ground.  Frames gone for sterilization with acetic acid.

4/4/2014 Only 1 seam of bees, a few sealed cells but plenty of stores.  No signs of recent queen activity.  I guess the queen didn't make it.

28/12/2013 Oxalic acid treatment.

2/9/2012 Lots of drones flying around the entrance of the hive. Superceding queen mating?

26/8/2012 Removed MAQS and put on a clearer board.  They have no stores and will need feeding tomorrow.

18/8/2013 Took off the clearer board and put on MAQS between the brood boxes added one empty super for the bees to move up into.

17/8/2013 Removed the supers.  It was cold so I left the clearer board in place.

16/8/2013 Single queen cell on cull frame in the bottom brood box.  Superseding?  Maybe, because she wasn't laying properly.  I did see some eggs so she is laying a bit.  They are quiet on the frames so I'll let the supersedure proceed.  Configured to 8 x 8 and put on the clearer board to clear down three the supers.

28/7/2013 There is a peculiar gap at F5 beside the cull frame.  Maybe is smells wrong?  I did see eggs on F11 but not many didn't see the queen.  Worrying.

13/7/2013 Did not see queen but saw eggs, so queen is present.

7/7/2013 No signs of a queen, but not upset.  Put a frame of eggs and grubs in at F5 to test if queenless.

9/6/2013 Removed more emergency queen cells and left a single cell on the cull frame.  Put matches under the cover board for ventilation.  Leave for 3 weeks.

6/6/2013 Removed emergency queen cells and left a single cell (from [Buster]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2012-buster.html)) on the cull frame.  The supers were nearly full so I added a third one.

2/6/2013 Removed the queen ([Buster]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2012-buster.html)) and left 3 unsealed queen cells marked with round headed pins.  There are two queen cells on the cull frame.  Bad tempered.

26/5/2013 Put on another super, a handful of queen cups none charged.  Very pissed and followed me and Ben to the yard.

19/5/2013 Put on a super.

18/5/2013 Removed feeder, did not see the queen but saw eggs, some free drones, plenty of bees.  Some space for stores but needs supers.

6/5/2013 Added feeder with thin syrup.

20/4/2013 Queen present and laying, no free drones.

29/3/2013 Check the candy, very little eaten.

6/1/2013 Put on a block of candy.

1/1/2013 Oxalic acid treatment.

14/9/2012 Removed Apiguard treatment.

16/8/2012 Added second Apiguard treatment, and feed.

3/8/2012 Started Apiguard treatment, and feeding.

29/7/2012 Put a super on top, they need another brood frame. Swapped position with [Kentucky]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2012-kentucky.html), so exchanged flying bees.
