## White Marked 2013 Queen

6/8/2014 Gave the queen to Ruth then merged with [Nicky]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2014-nicky.html).

31/7/2014 Moved to where [Nicky]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2014-nicky.html) is because she looks like a nice queen.

30/7/2014 Spotted and marked the queen. She looks nice and big and is laying well.

23/7/2014 Found a queen laying, well eggs and grubs in the hive on top of [Nicky]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2014-nicky.html).  Couldn't find the queen.
