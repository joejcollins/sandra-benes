## Red Marked Queen

10/6/2014 Sold to Pauline.

8/6/2014 Marked the Queen.

5/6/2014 Checked for signs of a queen.  Lots of sealed cells and eggs.  So all is well.

26/5/2014 No signs of a queen, no eggs, pissed off.  Brought over a set of eggs from [Nicky]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2014-nicky.html).

20/5/2014 Added two more of the sterilized frames.  They were covering all the frames.

18/5/2014 Collected swarm from Batch Valley with Nick.  Hived on to the frames that were sterilized with acetic acid.
