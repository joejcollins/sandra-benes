## Red marked Queen

2018-04-22 Sold to Dan.

2018-04-21 Marked the queen.

2018-04-18 Checked all the frames, more honey, but I had to take some of it away because I was squeezing them down onto 11 frames.  Didn't see the queen but there were eggs and shed loads of bees.  There was also a few patches of drone comb.

2018-04-16 Spoke to Dan who agreed to take this colony.

2018-04-08 Checked all the frames, not much honey.  Saw eggs and brood, some of it looked like it might be drone brood.  I put a feeder on, if it rains they have no stores.

2018-04-07 Checked the candy, they have scoffed most of it.

2018-02-17 Checked the candy, not showing through.

2017-12-28 Api-Bioxal treatment, also put on a takeaway dish with candy in it so I can see when they run low on stores.

2017-08-20 Apiguard treatment.

2017-08-04 Apiguard treatment.  Still seem pissed off.

2017-08-04 Unmarked queen, present and laying.  Fast moving on the frames and seem pissed off.

2017-07-23 Seem a bit pissed off.  Heavy supers.  Didn't see the queen but I saw eggs.  Lots of brood about to pop.

2017-07-17 Saw brood and eggs.  Didn't see the queen but all appears to be well.

2017-07-08 Lots of drones and shiny cells.  They seemed fractious and I didn't see any eggs or brood.  The supers seemed heavy.

2017-07-02 Queen cell emerged.  Took down everything else that looked like a queen cell.

2017-07-01 One unopened queen cell.  Polished cells.

2017-06-19 Some emergency cells (about 4) being developed but only half heartedly.  There is a sealed one at the bottom of F4 but it looks nasty.

2017-06-17 Put a frame of eggs from [Andrea]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2017-andrea.html) at F4 counting from the South.  There should be an unmated queen but after finding a new queen looking dead under  [Andrea]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2017-andrea.html) yesterday I am not sure.

2017-06-09 Queen cell open but no signs of laying queen.  Top super is full and could be extracted.  Could give them another brood frame to draw.

2017-05-14 Culled the queen cells leaving one of the two at the bottom of F4.  I stabbed the other one with a pin to kill it.  This should leave only one viable queen cell.  If not then there is the old queen ([Andrea]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2017-andrea.html)) available to add new eggs and recover the situation.  Swapped the hive into a position of the original hive so the original flying bees are coming to this hive, so this will be the production hive fed with bees from [Andrea]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2017-andrea.html).

2017-05-12 Had another look the queen cell on F3.  It doesn't look good, the 2 queen cells at the bottom of F4 look fine still and there is an unsealed queen cell at the top of F6 (the one at the bottom is buggered).  I will leave it and check in a few days time, probably go for one of the 2 queen cells at the bottom of F4.

2017-05-10  Brood and queen cells from [Andrea]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2017-andrea.html) which was artificially swarmed. Queen cells on frames numbered from the South, F3 white pin, bottom, one unsealed, F4 green pin, bottom, two sealed and F6 white pin, bottom, one unsealed.
