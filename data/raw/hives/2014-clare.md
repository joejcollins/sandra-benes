## 2015 Queen

3/8/2015 Queen killed and queen cell destroyed.  Merged with [Bella]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2015-bella.html).

2/8/2015 Saw a single queen cell on the face of one frame but also saw the queen and eggs.  Not sure what is going on here.

17/7/2015 Saw eggs.  I have been feeding this one and the bees cover 3 frames so I guess they are flying less because it isn't necessary.

10/7/2015 Only enough bees to cover 1-2 frames but a lot of flying going on.

6/7/2014 Collected from a tree in the orchard, no idea which hive it came from.
