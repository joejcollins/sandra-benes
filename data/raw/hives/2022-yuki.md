## 2022 Marked Queen

2023-04-18 Sold.

2023-04-15 Squeezed down on to 10 frames of brood and one of honey.

2023-04-13 About 6 frames with brood in the top, 4 frames in the bottom.  Saw the queen and eggs.

2023-02-18 Candy all gone so I put on a feeder.

2023-01-02 API-Bioxal (oxalic acid treatment) and candy block.

2022-09-18 Took off the Apiguard treatment.

2022-08-28 Added the second Apiguard treatment.

2022-08-14 Merged with 11 frames from [Yulinar]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2022-yulinar.html) and added the first Apiguard treatment.

2022-07-24 Added another frame to make them up to 11 and added a feeder so they can draw the frame.

2022-07-23 Saw eggs and brood, didn't see the queen.  Could do with another frame to make them up to 11.

2022-07-16 Saw eggs and brood, looking fine still covering about 4 frames.

2022-07-08 Found the new queen and marked her.  They are covering about 4 frames.

2022-06-04 There are only enough bees to cover a couple of frames.  They seem pissed and are filling the cells with nectar, not preparing for a laying queen.  I am suspicious so we added a queen cell and some brood from [Whitney]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2021-whitney.html).  The queen cell is on the bottom of frame 6 (counting from the south) and marked with a black pin.  Check in 35 days.  Also added a feeder because it is such a small colony.

 Culled down to a single queen cell on the north side of frame 4 counting from the south.  Marked with a white pin.

2022-06-02 Swarm from [Winnie]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2021-winnie.html).
