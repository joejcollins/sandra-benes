## 2025 Marked Queen

2025-08-16 Sold.

2025-08-03 Saw the queen, eggs and brood they have stores but are not busting out.  The weather is still dry so maybe not much nectar.

2025-07-21 Saw the queen, raised the number of frames to 11 ready for sale.

2025-07-14 Saw the queen, eggs and brood.  They are not drawing out the comb.  Maybe because of the drought there is no nectar.

2025-07-05 Saw eggs and brood, no signs of swarming.  Saw the queen.  Reduced the entrance because there are lots of wasps around.

2025-06-30 Put on a clearer board for the top super.

2025-06-29 Saw the queen, saw eggs no signs of swarming.  They really aren't using the supers so I will take off the top one.

2025-06-21 Found the queen and marked her.  Eggs and larvae in all stages but not a lot of sealed brood.  The supers aren't really getting filled.

2025-06-13 Checked for a laying queen.  Saw a small patch of eggs but no grubs yet.

2025-05-30 Two supers are full so I put on a clearer board to clear one down and put on another empty super.

2025-05-23 The top box just had wooden edges as starters, they haven't tried drawing comb off them yet.

2025-05-13 Added another super because it is so warm and there are so many bees.

2025-05-08 Culled down to one queen cell on the bottom of frame 6, marked with a red pin.

2025-05-02 Frames with queen cells and eggs from [Regina]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2023-regina.html) to raise an emergency queen.  There are loads of bees so it should be fine.
