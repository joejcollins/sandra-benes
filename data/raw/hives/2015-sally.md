## 2015 Queen

10/8/2015 Removed the queen (caged it just in case) and merged with [Camillla]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2015-camilla.html).

6/8/2015 Saw eggs, so there is a queen, she has only just started laying though.  This is going to merge with [Camillla]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2015-camilla.html) so I reduced the number of frames to 9.

2/8/2015 No queen, no signs of eggs or brood.  Pissed off.  No sign of the queen cell on the cull frame.  The cells above are polished so they might be expecting an emerged queen to mate.

8/7/2015 Cut down to a single queen cell on the cull frame, marked with a pin.

7/7/2015 Masses of queen cells on the cull frame.  No sign of eggs or the queen.

23/6/2015 Laying eggs on one frame, but very pissed off.

4/6/2015 Not working the top super yet, didn't bother looking in the brood chamber.

26/5/2015 Went through the brood chamber and took down queen cells and emergency cells.  Left the one queen cell on the cull frame.  The queen cell looked well developed and had red markings around the bottom end.  Top super not really being used.

23/5/2015  Took down took down spare queen cells and 10  emergency cells.  Left one queen cell on the cull frame.  There was nectar in the brood chamber and no sign of eggs.  A lot of pissed off bees though.

20/5/2015 Saw eggs and a sealed queen cells.  Couldn't find queen.  So split leaving two queen cells on the cull frame this box (this is the **top brood box**).  The bottom box (I am guessing with the queen in, but who knows) went to one side with [Nina]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2016-nina.html).  Most of the brood stayed in this box.
