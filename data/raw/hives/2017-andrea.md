## Queen Balled and Killed Under Hive

2017-06-17 They appeared to swarm but were limited because the queen was clipped.  One sealed queen cell on the South side of the cull frame marked with a black pin.  This queen to be named [Rosie]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2017-rosie.html).  The old queen [Andrea]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2017-andrea.html) was dead in clump with a new queen.  I put the new queen in a nucleus hive ([Teresa]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2019-teresa.html)) with 3 frames.

2017-06-09 Saw eggs, saw the queen, some cups but no signs of swarming.  About 6 seams of bees.  Continue feeding to draw foundation.  Five of the frames aren't drawn so I could give frame to  [Anne-Marie]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2017-anne-marie.html) at the next inspection.

2017-06-03 Saw eggs, saw the queen, some cups but no signs of swarming.  About 5 seams of bees.

2017-05-27 Saw eggs, didn't see the queen, some cups but no signs of swarming.

2017-05-18 Saw the queen, saw eggs.  Most of the bees are in the super and very few in the brood box.  I would like them to draw out the brood frames so I put on a clearer board.  I put a feeder on when the super comes off tomorrow.

2017-05-14 Saw the queen, didn't see eggs, swapped position with [Anne-Marie]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2017-anne-marie.html) to further deplete the flying bees and so this can be used as a feeder for [Anne-Marie]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2017-anne-marie.html).  Put a clearer board on so I can move one of the supers over to  [Anne-Marie]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2017-anne-marie.html) which will be the production hive.

2017-05-12 Pissed off, no signs of eggs and didn't see the queen.  I had forgotten to put in a frame of brood so I put one in from [Anne-Marie]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2017-anne-marie.html).  There were young grubs so it will allow me to check for queenlessness in a couple of days.

2017-05-10  Saw eggs and three sealed queen cells, so I artificially swarmed them, leaving the queen in place and removing the brood to the South and named [Anne-Marie]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2017-anne-marie.html).

2017-05-04 Busy, both supers have nectar in them.  Didn't see the queen but saw eggs and grubs.  Put another brood box under the current brood box to give the brood nest more space.

2017-04-28 Very busy so I took out the entrance block and put on another super.  Saw eggs and grubs.  Found the queen on the 2nd frame from the North (marked with yellow disk 35).  Some queen cups but none were charged.  They were kind of hanging on my suit.

2017-04-18 Very busy a few drones and drone cells on the way.  Didn't see the queen but saw eggs.  Removed feeder.  All the brood frame were covered so I added a super.

2017-03-31 Moved into my boxes.  Didn't see eggs, didn't see the queen, empty frames at the end of the box.  Feed as a precaution.

2017-03-27 Brought over by Charles in the morning.
