## Queenless

2019-06-22 United with [Kate]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2018-kate.html).

2019-06-14 Placed on top of [Kate]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2018-kate.html) with a view to merging them at some point.

2019-06-13 No signs of a laying queen.  Assumed to be queenless, will put on top of [Kate]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2018-kate.html) with a Snelgrove board.

2019-07-06 No signs of a laying queen.  The queen cell on the South side of the cull frame looks opened now but that has been there for at least a month so I don't think it is relevant.

2019-06-28 Found an apparently resealed queen cell on the South side of the cull frame.  Marked it with a white pin.  No sign of the queen cell on frame 6.  No signs of laying workers, so I will just leave it and see what happens.

2019-06-22 Checked the supers and a few of the brood frames for laying worker.  Nothing.  All looks OK, I didn't disturb the brood frame with the queen cell.

2019-06-14 There were 8-10 queen cells on the frame of eggs that I put in a week ago, so I culled them down to one and marked it with a white pin.  For the record it is on the South side of frame 6.

2019-06-06 the queen cell looks unopened.  Or re-closed?  No signs of laying so I put in a frame of eggs from [Kate]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2018-kate.html).  The frame had eggs on the bottom section and hone all around.  I left the pin in with the queen cell.

2019-05-02 Culled the queen cells leaving one on the South side of the cull frame, marked with a white pin.   There weren't that many queen cells (say 15) and there was a suspicious number of drone cells.

2019-04-25 Charged queen cells and flying bees from [Sonja]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2018-sonja.html)).
