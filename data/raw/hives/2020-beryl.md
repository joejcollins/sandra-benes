## 2020 Queen Marked Yellow

2021-04-18 Swapped into buyers hive.

2021-04-09 Sold.

2021-03-31 About 3-4 frames of unsealed brood, only in the bottom box towards the North.  Some signs of old queen cells.  Perhaps they swarmed or superseded at the end of last year.  Didn't see the queen.  A little bit pissed off.

2020-12-25 API-Bioxal (oxalic acid treatment).

2020-10-06 Looks like they have stopped feeding, so took the rapid feeder off.

2020-09-19 Apiguard treatment off.

2020-08-22 Second Apiguard treatment.

2020-08-08 Started Apiguard treatment.

2020-08-03 Removed supers, added an extra frame, put the undrawn frames on the top, and added a feeder.

2020-08-01 Saw the queen and eggs.  Added brood box and more frames underneath.  Put on the clearer board so I can take the supers off.  Once those are off I can start feeding so the frames can be drawn out.

2020-07-31 Saw eggs, grubs and the queen.  Marked the queen.  Reasonably quiet of the frames, so a keeper I think.  A lot of bees.

2020-07-23 Saw eggs (not a lot of them, perhaps they are slowing up?), grubs but didn't see the queen.  No signs of swarming.

2020-07-17 Queen cells but there are eggs and a lot of bees.  Couldn't find the queen.  Some queen cups, might be considering swarming?

2020-07-10 Lots of brood.  Saw eggs but didn't see the queen.  There are a lot of bees.  The supers are filling.

2020-06-23 Checked for a laying queen, loads of brood, saw eggs but didn't see the queen.

2020-06-02 Put on a clearer board to clear the top honey super.

2020-05-31 One honey super is ready to come off.

2020-05-21 Culled the queen cells, leaving one on the South side of one of the Northern frames marked with a black pin.

2018-05-14 Made up with 11 frames from [Kate]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2018-Kate.html).  Nice looking queen cell on face of frame marked with a black pin.
