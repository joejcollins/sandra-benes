## 2020 Queen Marked

2021-08-08 Emergency queen cells, no eggs, didn't see the queen.  I am guessing she is dead.  New queen designated [Wren]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2021-wren.html).

2021-08-01 Building up nicely, about 5 frames of eggs and brood.  Didn't see the queen.  There are a couple of frames that need drawing so they need to be fed but will probably need a super when the brood comes out.

2021-07-25 I saw eggs.  I was looking for eggs to donate to [Whitney]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2021-whitney.html) but the colony isn't strong enough to be a donor.  I will keep on feeding them.

2021-07-23 I saw eggs and saw the queen.

2021-07-14 I saw eggs and but didn't see the queen.

2021-07-11 Removed the queen excluder from underneath.  There were two charged but unsealed queen cells, I am guessing they are hang overs from the swarming so I took them down.  The queen was present and I saw eggs.

2021-07-08 Sealed queen cells, one even looks like it had emerged.  There were about 10 queen cells, about half on the bottoms of frames and half on the faces.  However I found the queen and moved her to one side, and put a queen excluder underneath.  Supercedure?  Maybe.  I don't understand how we missed the signs last time.  Anyway I made up a new colony [Winnie]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2021-winnie.html) in the original location with a sealed queen cell.

2021-07-01 I saw eggs and saw the queen.  There were a few queen cups but none were charged.  Lots of brood.

2021-06-26 I saw eggs and saw the queen.  There were queen cups one of which was quite well developed (long) but not charged.

2021-06-18 I saw eggs and saw the queen.  There were a few queen cups but none were charged.

2021-06-12 Looked at the frames from [Willow]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2021-willow.html) and they appear to be fine with no drones.  I was duped by the uneven early pattern which was very uneven and thought that I had a drone layer.  So that was a mistake.  Anyway I saw eggs but didn't see the queen.  There is a lot of brood so I expect the colony to expand fast.

2021-06-09 Added flying bees and frames from [Willow]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2021-willow.html) because it had a drone laying queen or worker.

2021-06-05 Saw brood and eggs but not the queen.  No signs of swarming.  With the super on and having moved it's location to bleed off some flying bees they didn't seem cramped (7 frames covered in the brood box).

2021-06-01 Saw brood and eggs but not the queen.  No signs of swarming but there are plenty of bees so I put on a super.

2021-05-27 Saw brood, eggs and the queen.  There was one queen cell on the face of a frame with two eggs in (which I took down).  There is plenty of honey in the frames and lots of bees so I moved it to bleed off some of the bees into [Wendy]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2021-wendy.html).

2021-05-14 Brood, eggs didn't see the queen no signs of swarming.  Building up, probably because there is a feeder on (because the weather had been poor).

2021-05-14 Brood, eggs, saw the queen no signs of swarming.  Very small.

2021-05-07 Brood, eggs, saw the queen no signs of swarming.  Very small.

2021-05-01 Brood, eggs, saw the queen no signs of swarming.

2021-04-24 Found queen cells, so moved Berenice to one side (to the South), left the queen cells to start a new colony ([Wendy]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2021-wendy.html)).  A lot of the flying bees appeared to just follow so they might have been in the mood to swarm.

2021-04-18 Brood, eggs, drones, drone comb, saw the queen, queen cups.  Lots of bees so I put on two supers.

2021-03-31 Brood in the top and bottom boxes.  About 5 frames of sealed brood, 3 frames of unsealed, some drone cells.  Saw the marked queen.  Nectar coming in.

2020-12-25 API-Bioxal (oxalic acid treatment).

2020-10-06 Looks like they have stopped feeding, so took the rapid feeder off.

2020-09-19 Apiguard treatment off.

2020-08-22 Second Apiguard treatment.

2020-08-08 Started Apiguard treatment.

2020-07-31 Saw eggs, grubs and the queen.  Marked the queen.  United on top of the frames from [Georgia]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2019-georgia.html).

2020-07-24 Saw eggs and grubs didn't see the queen.

2020-07-17 Saw eggs and grubs, didn't see the queen.  They seemed pretty mobile on the frames.  It was a warm day.

2020-07-10 Laying nice dark looking queen.  Saw eggs and grubs.  Not a lot of stores.  Needs feeding.

2020-06-23 Only covering 2 frames, no signs of a laying queen but they do seem calm.  None of the frames was drawn enough for laying.

2020-06-17  Swarm collected from Little Stretton.
