## 2024 Marked Queen

2024-09-22 Sold.

2024-08-09 Covering all the frames.

2024-07-27 Saw eggs, grubs and sealed brood.  Saw the queen and marked her. There aren't so many bees so reduced to 11 frames.

2024-07-09 Went through the colony and took down three queen cells, all of which looked like they were viable.  It would have been better to wait 8 days rather than cull the queen cells after 6 days like we did.

2024-07-09 Swarmed into the tree north of the bee hives.  Boxed up as [Gabrielle]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2024-gabrielle.html).

2024-07-07 Swarmed on to one of the orchard fence posts.  Boxed up as [Gail]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2024-gail.html).

2024-06-25 Culled the queen cells down to one on the south face of the second frame in from the south.  They are drawing the frames in the top brood box so I will carry on feeding.  This was a day earlier than planned (so only a 6 day interval) but we thought we got them all.

2024-06-19 Created with brood frames from [Yvette]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2022-yvette.html).  The top brood box is un-drawn frames and the bottom box is new grubs and eggs.    Put a feeder on so the house bees can start drawing the frames.
