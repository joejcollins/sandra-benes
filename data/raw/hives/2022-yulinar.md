## 2022 Queen Cell

2022-08-14 No signs of eggs and emergency cells had been drawn on the frame of eggs I added a few days ago.  I took down the emergency cells and united the two boxes with [Yuki]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2022-yuki.html) and [Whitney]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2021-whitney.html).

2022-08-09 Added a frame on mixed sealed brood, larvae and eggs from [Whitney]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2021-whitney.html) in the top box, 6th from the east.

2022-08-06 Checked through but didn't seen any signs of a laying queen.  The remains of the queen cell on the 3rd frame counting from the west was still there but I couldn't tell if it had hatched.

2022-07-30 Put on a clearer.  They seem well behaved and quiet, but I didn't look through them.

2022-07-13 The queen cell in the bottom box was torn open on the side.  But there was a queen cell in the top box, on the east side of the 3rd frame counting from the west, marked with an orange pin.  There was one other emergency cell which I took down.  There were no eggs and all the larvae I saw were segmented.  There aren't a lot of bees in the top box, so it is available if one of the other hives needs it.

2022-07-08 [Whitney]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2021-whitney.html) swarmed.  There were eggs in some of the cells but not many.  I guess it wasn't a supercedure like I had thought.  Went through the colony and culled all the queen cells leaving one, marked with an orange pin on the bottom of frame 4 from the north in the bottom box.  There were still a few eggs so I should probably go back a few days and check for emergency cells.
