## 2025 Unmarked Queen

2025-06-21 Turns out that [Regina]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2023-regina.html) is still there and all the frames are laid up.  So I guess the little brown queen didn't make it.  We remarked her for good measure.

2025-06-13 All the paper is gone from the end of the Butler cage.  There were eggs but no grubs yet.  We saw a smallish light coloured queen.  But she was unmarked so I am guessing that [Regina]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2023-regina.html) didn't make it and this is a late queen from a cell that I missed.  Maybe.  It is a bit hard to tell.

2025-06-07 Since there is no sign of a queen, I transferred [Regina]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2023-regina.html) back in using a Butler cage.

2025-06-06 Probably queenless, no eggs or grubs.  The queen cell we left was broken open on the side.  I guess there is a chance that there was a cell we left but I think it unlikely.  Moved towards [Bobby]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2025-bobby.html) so that the bees can be merged with another colony, maybe [Belinda]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2025-belinda.html).-regina.html)

2025-05-06 Culled to one queen cell on the bottom of frame 6 marked with a green pin.

2025-04-28 Frames with eggs from [Regina]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2023-regina.html) to raise an emergency queen.  There are loads of bees so it should be fine.
