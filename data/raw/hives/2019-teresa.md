## 2019 Queen

2018-08-0 Shook out and the frames put in [Sonja]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2018-sonja.html).

2018-08-06 Drone laying worker.

2018-08-02 No sign of a laying queen, looks like they are dying out.  To be merged with [Kate]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2018-kate.html).

2018-07-07 No queen, saw three queen cells, culled them down to one queen cell.  Marked the frame with green pin.

2018-06-21 Saw the queen and eggs.

2018-06-07 Appears not to busy and now signs of swarming.  Didn't see the queen but I saw eggs.

2018-05-31 Removed 3 frames of brood and put them in [Kate]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2018-kate.html).  Brought three empty frames over from Kate.  The empty frames from Kate went in at positions 5, 6 and 7.

2018-05-28 Checked, no signs of swarming.  Saw eggs and the queen.

2018-05-23 Checked, no signs of swarming.  Saw eggs but not the queen.  I hadn't bleed off the bees so they have run out of space.  I will add 3 frames and move the hive to the other side of the production hive.

2018-05-17 Checked, no signs of swarming.  Saw eggs and the queen.  There isn't much space so it might be a good time to bleed off some bees to slow things down.

2018-05-13 Checked, no signs of swarming.  Saw eggs but didn't see the queen.

2018-05-10 Signs of impending swarming so I preemptively removed the queen to one side on 7 frames and added one more frame.

2018-05-05 Lots of eggs and brood.  More drone brood.  Didn't see the queen but saw eggs.  About 10 queen cups.

2018-04-22 Tried checking but the weather was too bad and they were pissed off.

2018-04-18 Checked all the frames, more honey.  Didn't see the queen, but saw eggs.  One uncharged queen cup.  There are shed loads of bees so I will stop feeding and put on the supers.

2018-04-08 Checked the top layer of 8 frames, maybe 3 frames of stores and 3 frames with brood or eggs.  Didn't see the queen.  I put a feeder on.

2018-04-07 Checked the candy, they have scoffed most of it.

2018-02-17 Checked the candy, not showing through.

2017-12-28 Api-Bioxal treatment, also put on a takeaway dish with candy in it so I can see when they run low on stores.

2017-08-20 Apiguard treatment.

2017-08-04 Apiguard treatment.  Quiet.  I like.

2017-08-04 United with the bees from [Trisha]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2017-trisha.html).

2017-07-23 The merging seems to have gone OK.  The frames which this queen laid seem very quiet.  I marked the queen yellow.  The frames from [Rosie]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2017-rosie.html) seem more pissed off.  Genetics?  Anyway I restacked the frames into one brood box.  A total of 11F with 7F of bees.

2017-07-18 Merged with [Rosie]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2017-rosie.html) using newspaper having taken down all the emergency queen cells in [Rosie]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2017-rosie.html).

2017-07-17 Brood so the queen must be laying.  I was in a hurry so I didn't mark her.

2017-07-08 No pollen coming in.  Saw the queen, didn't mark her because she didn't seem to be laying.

2017-07-02 The queen cell has emerged.  Leave to see what happens.

2017-07-01 There were three opened queen cells.  One was properly opened at the bottom and the other two looked like they had been opened from the side.  So I guess they were queenless and have now made a new queen.  The remaining brood is developing normally but there were no eggs so if there is a queen she is not laying yet.

2017-06-18 No signs of queenlessness.  There were grubs that could have been used.

2017-06-17 Found queen on the ground below [Andrea]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2017-andrea.html) together with the old queen (who was clearly dead).  My working theory is that the old queen swarmed and fell on the floor during the same time while this queen was out on a mating flight.  The new queen comes back and confusion ensues.  Both queens get balled in the process.
