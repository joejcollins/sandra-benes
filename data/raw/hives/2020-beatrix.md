2020-08-01 Sold.

2020-07-31 Saw eggs, grubs and the queen.  Marked the queen.  There are 10 frames that are drawn and one not drawn.  It was a nice day but they were fractious and there was a lot of propolis.

2020-07-24 Saw eggs and grubs didn't see the queen.

2020-07-17 Saw eggs, grubs and the queen.  She was moving pretty fast so I didn't try and mark her.
