## 2015 Queen

23/12/2015 Oxalic acid treatment.  Pissed off.

24/9/2015 Put on a super to be dried by the bees.

17/9/2015 Removed apiguard treatment.

7/8/2015 Put on the first Apiguard treatment.

6/8/2015 Took a frame of eggs and gave it to [Camilla]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2015-camilla.html).  Put in 2 extra frames from [Sally]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2015-sally.html) to get 8 x 8.  This one will be ready for the Apiguard treatment at the weekend.

2/8/2015 Saw eggs but didn't see the queen.  Moved to where [Marit]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2015-marit.html) was.

18/7/2015 No signs of emergency cells being built so I must assume that there is a queen in there.

16/7/2015 No sign of eggs, put in a frame of eggs from [Ulrika]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2014-ulrika.html) to see if they make up queen cells.  I put this frame right in the middle at number 4.

12/7/2015 No sign of eggs, but plenty of polished cells.  I don't get a sense that they are queenless so I will wait.

9/7/2015 They appeared to swarm today, over to one of Welland's trees.  While I was preparing to get them they came back.  Strange.

8/7/2015 Appeared to swarm today, but then go back.  The returners were fanning like mad on the front so I thought that a queen might have gone for a mating flight.  Maybe when the queen goes on a mating flight some of the bees get a confused message.  I took down the remaining queen cell on the assumption that this was the case.

7/7/2015 The marked cell had been taken down, but there were others so I left one of those.

27/6/2015 Took down emergency queen cells.  The marked cell still looks good and has a red and thickened end.  I have the feeling she might be coming out soon.

23/6/2015 Frames from [Dominique]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2014-dominique.html) with queen cell, marked with a pin.
