## 2024 Marked Queen

2024-08-25 Sold on.

2024-08-17 About 10 frames of bees, transferred into the buyers box.

2024-08-09 About 9 frames of bees, looking good, suitable for sale.

2024-08-02 Swopped position with [Yvette]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2022-yvette.html) so the surplus bees can build up the colony.

2024-07-26 Really only on two frames, but saw eggs, grubs and sealed brood.  Saw the queen (brown and a good size) and marked her.

2024-07-19 They had made comb between the end wall and dummy board, so I cleaned it out.  They are only on two frames.  I saw the queen looking large and brown.  But I had interfered enough so I didn't check if she was laying or not.

2024-07-09 Swarm from [Gwendolyn]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2024-gwendolyn.html).
