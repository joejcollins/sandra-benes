## 2015 Queen

23/12/2015 Oxalic acid treatment.  Calm.

24/9/2015 Put on a super to be dried by the bees.

17/9/2015 Removed apiguard treatment.

7/8/2015 Put on the first Apiguard treatment.

2/8/2015 Saw eggs but didn't see the queen.  Added another brood box and the frames from [Marit]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2015-marit.html).  Set up as crossed eights.

16/7/2015 Saw eggs but didn't see the queen.  Took out a frame of eggs and gave it to [Bella]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2015-bella.html).  They seem pretty pissed off for some reason, even though the weather is good.

7/7/2015 Saw eggs but didn't see the queen.

23/6/2015 Laying eggs on three frames.

4/6/2015 Not working the top super yet, didn't bother looking in the brood chamber.

26/5/2015 Extremely busy in the front of the hive.  Swarm? Queen emerged?  Top super is almost full of bees.

23/5/2015  Took down a few queen cells and 2 emergency cells.  There is nectar in the brood chamber and no sign of eggs.  Left one queen cell on the cull frame.  The queen cell looked well developed and had red markings around the bottom end.  My money says that it might be about to pop.  A lot of pissed off bees.

18/5/2015 Pissed off.  I think this is the one without the queen.  The queen cell remains on the cull frame.  Added another 3 three frames with eggs from [Dominique]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2014-dominique.html) to get to 11 frames.  If they make emergency cells with the eggs then this is definitely the one without the queen.   This was the **bottom brood box**.

16/5/2015 Saw queen cells and eggs but couldn't find queen.  Left a queen cell in both hives and split them.  This one had a queen cell on the cull frame and was left in the hive with the supers.  The other queen cell went with [Dominique]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2014-dominique.html) and the 9 frames on one side.  The plan is to review on Monday afternoon.  I should be able to tell which hive has the queen in at that point.

10/5/2015  Saw eggs but didn't see the queen. There was some drone comb in the super.  No signs of swarming.

5/4/2015 No signs of swarming, saw eggs but didn't see the queen. Culled some drone comb.

26/4/2015 Lots of brood, possibly running out of laying space.  Didn't see the queen.  It was cool weather so they were a little pissed off.

18/4/2015 Plenty of brood and food.  Saw eggs but didn't see the queen.  Put on a single super.

10/4/2015 Quick nose in the top.  Plenty of food and bees.  Maybe add supers?

5/4/2015 Most of the 9 frames in the top are jammed with honey.  The bottom box has eggs, grubs and brood frames.  Very busy.  No worries about food or stimulation.  Didn't see the queen.

25/12/2014 Oxalic acid treatment.  There were 6 seams of bees (big colony) in the bottom box towards the North side.  Plenty of weight in the top box.  Put on candy block.

17/9/2014 Took off the Apiguard, plenty of bees and honey.

6/8/2014 Put on the first Apiguard treatment.  They seemed a bit cramped and might need another brood frame.

4/8/2014 Didn't see the queen but no chalkbrood and lots of eggs.

17/7/2014 Saw brood and eggs, but didn't see the queen.  A lot of chalkbrood, not working the super.

10/7/2014 Saw brood and eggs, but didn't see the queen.  No signs of swarming.  Not working their super very much.

30/6/2014 Saw brood and eggs, but didn't see the queen.  No signs of swarming but masses of brood.  Put on a super to give them something to do.

20/6/2014 Merge has gone well.  Eggs and brood, didn't see the queen.

12/6/2014 No signs of a queen (no eggs or brood) but plenty of polished cells.

19/5/2014 Merged in [Garton]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2012-garton.html).

18/5/2014 Cut down to one queen cell, marked with a pin.

13/5/2014 Created from [Garton]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2012-garton.html).  Four queen cells.  Two on the bottom of the cull frame one of which (in the middle at the bottom) is sealed.  All marked with pins.
