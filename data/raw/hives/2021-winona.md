## Queen Cell

2021-09-17 No signs of a laying queen.  Just three frames of bees.  United on top of [Wren]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2021-wren.html).

2021-09-04 Not so many bees so I took off the supers.  Maybe they swarmed while we were away.  There are polished cells but no sign of eggs.

2021-08-20 It is three weeks since the queen came out and there are no signs of eggs so I added a queen cell from [Berenice]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2020-berenice.html) on a frame in a paper bag.

2021-08-08 No eggs but there were polished brood cells.

2021-08-01 The cell with the red pin had popped and still had a lid attached.  No eggs but there were polished brood cells.  The top super is pretty heavy and there are lots of bees so will add another super so I can remove the top one for extraction.

2021-07-26 At about 13hrs00 loads of bees came out an swirled about looking like they might swarm, but then went back in again after about 20 minutes.  Mating flight?

2021-07-25 Since [Winnie]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2021-winnie.html) was laying.  I thought I would check this one too.  No signs of laying.  However there were a couple of opened queen cells and about five sealed queen cells.  I cull all but one of the sealed queen cells.  The remaining queen cell is marked with a red pin on the second frame from the North.

2021-07-14 Culled all the emergency queen cells, I am hoping the un-mated queen is still in there.

2021-07-08 Made up with 11 frames from [Berenice]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2020-berenice.html) and removed to the side.  There was a clearly emerged queen cell despite the fact that I found the queen and there were eggs.  Also there were various other queen cells in a range of states.  I guess they might have been superceding and swarming at the same time.  Why not?  It would be a good summertime plan.  Anyway I am assuming that the queen is there so I will cull any queen cells in a week to ensure that no other queens can be raised.
