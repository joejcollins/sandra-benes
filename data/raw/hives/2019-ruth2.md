## 2019 Supersedure or swarmed?

2019-08-23 Laying working, lots of drone brood.  Shook out and burnt the messed up frames.

2019-08-03 No queen, no brood, and a bit pissed off.  Might be a good time to treat with oxalic acid.  It will be interesting to see if the queen will mate.  I think she might if we have a bit of an indian summer.

2019-07-29 No grubs or eggs but I found three opened queen cells close together on the 7th from from the South.  I am guessing a supersedure might be going on.  No idea why but the queen always seemed a bit unproductive.  I will just leave them to it.

2019-07-13 They aren't really clearing off the crystallized honey in the super.  However there is loads of young brood and bees on all the frames.

2019-07-07 Put on a crystallized super to get them to eat the crystals.

2019-07-05 Marked the queen yellow.  There were plenty of eggs.  United with 6 frames from a failed production/mating hive.

2019-06-29 Weak 5 frame nucleus from neighbor with 2018 queen, added 2 frames for stores and put on a feeder to build them up.
