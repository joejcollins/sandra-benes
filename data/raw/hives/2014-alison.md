## Unmated Queen

10/7/2014 Yeah, yeah, yeah, loads of emergency cells.  Even a queen just coming out (I killed her).  I took down all the emergency cells.  Will then merge with [Nicky]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2014-nicky.html).

6/7/2014 Lots of bees clumped on the outside of the hive.  Queen mating?  Nope swarming.  The went off towards Church Stretton.

20/6/2014 One sealed queen cell marked with a yellow pin.  The queen cell came from [Nicky]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2014-nicky.html).  The cell was a really big good looking one right on the bottom of the frame.  Heaving with bees so I put on two supers.
