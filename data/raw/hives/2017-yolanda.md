## Drone Laying Worker

2017-07-17 Shook out and removed the hive.  While I was doing this I found a queen (probably from that poor queen cell I saw last time).  Anyway I bagged her up on a frame and put the bagged frame into

2017-07-08 No pollen coming in. I couldn't see if the queen cell had emerged.  There was a nasty looking queen cell on the bottom of F6.  I left it incase they did in the queen that emerged last week.  There were some young grubs in odd places so I am not convinced that the drone laying worker problem has been solved.  Generally they seemed incoherent.  I am wondering about using the Snelgrove board and putting  [Dina]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2016-dina.html) on top so they get some pheromones and/or are ready to merge.

2017-07-02 Took a queen cell that was about to pop from [Rosie]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2017-rosie.html) and put it on the site.  Took the box to Maggies land and shook out all the bees.  The hope is that the new queen will take and correct the drone laying worker.  Scrapped down the frames in the hope that the bees will rework them.

2017-07-01 Laying worker, so there is lots of drone brood developing.  They are making queen cells based on the two frames of brood.

2017-06-17 Didn't see eggs or a queen there are shiny cells.  I put two frames of brood in from [Dina]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2016-dina.html) to keep up the numbers and to confirm the state of the queen.

2017-05-18 Left a single queen cell at the top of F8 (on the South side) counting from the South.  Took down all the other queen cells.  Swapped position with [Dina]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2016-dina.html) so that this hive gets all the flying bees and is now the production hive.

2017-05-12  Brood and queen cells from [Dina]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2016-dina.html) which was artificially swarmed. Queen cells on frames numbered from the South F6 blue pin, top, one unsealed and F8 red pin, bottom, two unsealed with another blue pin, top, one unsealed
