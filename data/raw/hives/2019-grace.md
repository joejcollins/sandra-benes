## 2019 Queen marked but the marking is rubbing off

2020-04-12 Sold to Rachel.

2020-04-05 Removed the feeder and reduced to 11 frames.

2020-03-22 Topped up the feeder.  They are bringing in pollen.

2020-02-21 Just over half the syrup has been used, so I filled it up.  I could see the cluster by the top hole, but they weren't feeding on the syrup.

2020-02-02 Eaten about half the candy, leaving about 600 g of candy.  Put on a contact feeder with 1 to 1 syrup (650 g sugar and 650 g water is enough to fill a peanut butter contact feeder).

2020-01-18 Bees flying at 12hrs00.  Sunny day, 5 C.

2020-01-17 Tip weight including stand 15.0 kg, not seen on candy.

2019-12-23 Apibioxal oxalic acid treatment using the trickle method.

2019-09-21 Took the Apiguard treatment off.

2019-08-23 Second Apiguard treatment.

2019-08-08 Put on Apiguard and a bowl feeder.

2019-08-03 Saw eggs and the queen (marked but not very effectively).  Moved to beside [Ruth2]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2019-ruth2.html) in case I want to united them but also to reduce the number of flying bees.  Put on a clearer board to get off one of the supers.

2019-07-18 Culled the drone brood. Saw the queen, saw eggs.  No signs of swarming.

2019-07-13 Saw the queen, saw eggs.  No signs of swarming.

2019-07-06 Saw the queen and marked her yellow.  A bit of paint got on her wing.  No signs of swarming.

2019-06-28 Saw brood and eggs.  Had a good hunt for the queen but didn't see her.

2019-06-09 Loads of brood, loads of eggs.  Didn't see the queen.

2019-06-02 There is a patch of normal sealed worker brood, it is a little bit uneven age wise, but I guess she is just finding her feet.  It was too windy to do a full inspection and actually find her but it looks like we are on line.  Also added a frame of sealed brood largely to deplete [Kate]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2018-kate.html/) a little bit.

2019-05-30 Small patch of brood on the frame North of the frame with the white pin.  Can't tell if it is the result of a drone layer but there seemed to be more brood food that I would expect.  Not sure what is going on.

2019-05-25 Checked the queen cell, neatly opened. There are stores of both honey and pollen.  According to my schedule I should put in a frame of eggs.  Mags says no, I think she is right, it looks good so there is no point to interfering.

2019-04-25 Culled the queen cells down to one cell on the bottom (South side) of frame marked with a white pin.

2019-04-18 Made up with 7 frames of brood from [Rachel]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2018-rachel.html).
