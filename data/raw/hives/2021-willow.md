## 2021 Queen

2021-06-12 Looked at the frames in [Berenice]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2020-berenice.html) and they appear to be fine not drones.  I was duped by the uneven early pattern.

2021-06-09 Drone laying queen or worker.  The eggs were at the bottom of the cells so I assume it was a drone laying queen.  The weather for mating was terrible so I guess it isn't surprising.  I took off the supers and shook all the bees out in the top of the field.   All the frames and flying bees went into [Berenice]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2020-berenice.html).

2021-06-05 Saw eggs apparently just started laying, since there were no grubs.

2021-05-27 No eggs, no brood and didn't see the queen.  They seem settled like there might be a queen.

2021-05-14 Swarm from [Georgia]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2021-wendy.html).
