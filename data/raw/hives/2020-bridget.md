## 2020 Unmarked Queen

2020-08-30 Sold rather than merge back into [Bethany]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2020-bethany.html) which seems pretty strong as it is.

2020-08-27 Laying queen, plenty of brood and stores.  Really chock full of bees so I bled some off into [Bethany]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2020-bethany.html).

2020-07-31 There was an opened queen cell, looks like I might have missed one.

2020-07-24 Took down all the queen cells I could find.

2020-07-17 Made up with 9 frames from [Bethany]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2020-bethany.html).  Unsealed queen cell on the top, North side of frame marked with a red pin.
