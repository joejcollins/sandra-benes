## 2025 Marked Queen

2025-09-06 Apiguard tray two on.  Also added half a block of Candipolline Gold.

2025-08-28 Put on a blob of MegaBee (which was made up from 75 g of MegaBee powder and thick syrup).

2025-08-25 Put on a patty of MegaBee (which was made up from 50 g of MegaBee powder and thick syrup).  Also put on a 330 g of Candipolline Gold to see if they would like that too.  Also added thick syrup in a bowl and straw feeder.

2025-08-22 Apiguard on, 10 days late.

2025-08-22 Varroa slide out.  Count 75.  The slide was in for 5 days not 7, so the daily count is 15.  The National Bee unit say that May to August: Multiply by 30.  Giving 450.  Treatment must happen before you reach 1000.

2025-08-17 Put in the varroa slide.

2025-08-16 Some eggs and brood in the top box.  Empty cells in the bottom box.  Didn't see the queen.  The have eaten/removed about a third of the patty.  There is plenty of yellow dust under the hive so it could be either or both.  This hive is a bit lighter than the others so could benefit from some syrup.

2025-08-13 Put on a patty of MegaBee (which was made up from 125 g of MegaBee powder and thick syrup).

2025-08-08 Saw the queen but no eggs or brood.  There is only a small patch of brood.

2027-07-21 Added two more frames so now they are on cross 10s with dummy boards.

2025-07-14 Saw eggs and brood but didn't see the queen.  There is stored syrup but nothing in the super.

2025-07-05 Saw eggs and brood, no signs of swarming.  Reduced the entrance because there are lots of wasps around.

2025-06-30 Upgraded to 9 x 9 frames.

2025-06-29 Saw the queen, saw eggs no signs of swarming.  But there is a bit of back filling.  They probably need a couple more brood frames.

2025-06-21 Found the queen and marked her.  Eggs and larvae in all stages.

2025-06-13 Saw eggs no signs of swarming.  Saw the queen, she is a nice dark colour.

2025-06-07 Laying queen with brood at all stages of development.

2025-05-13 It seems all the bees have ended up in here so I swapped position with [Regina]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2023-regina.html) to give the old queen some more bees.  It might be too late because she should be on her mating flight around now.

2025-05-04 Culled queen cells.  Left one on the bottom of the cull frame marked with a white pin.  There aren't that many bees in there, maybe 3 seams of bees.  It could easily be just a nuc.

2025-04-28 Frames with queen cells and eggs from [Regina]({{ site.baseurl }}/queens/2023-regina.html) to raise an emergency queen.  There are loads of bees so it should be fine.
